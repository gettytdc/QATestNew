	</div>

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>The 'Process Validation' tool tests for a number of potential
		errors in your Blue Prism Process or Visual Business Object.
		Using this tool will help you detect problems in your work
		before you <a
		href="frmStagePropertiesProcessInfo.htm#publishing">make it
		available</a> for use in <a href="frmControlRoom.htm">Control
		Room</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Detail</h3>
	<p>The following paragraphs give a more detailed examination of
		process/object validation and the concepts used within the
		interface to aid in identifying and resolving any process issues
	</p>

	<h5>Types of result</h5>
	<p>Validation results can be one of three types:</p>
	<dl class="bulleted">
		<dt>Error</dt>
		<dd>Errors are generally used to indicate problems which must be
			fixed in order to avoid your process / business object
			failing at runtime.</dd>

		<dt>Warning</dt>
		<dd>Warnings alert you to potential problems which may cause
			your process / business object to fail at runtime. You must
			use your discretion in deciding whether or not to ignore the
			error.</dd>

		<dt>Advice</dt>
		<dd>Advice can often give you useful information on how to make
			the process / business object easier to understand or
			improve the documentation, but does generally not include
			problems that will cause any failure during running.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h5>Sorting Results</h5>
	<p>Results may be sorted in order to group the results by Page,
		Stage Name, Type, etc. Simply click the header of interest (eg
		Stage Name) in order to sort according to that attribute (ie
		sort by Stage Name, in order). Clicking the same column again
		will toggle the sort order (eg from alphabetic to reverse
		alphabetic in the Stage Name column).</p>

	<h5>Getting Help</h5>
	<p>Sometimes background knowledge is available for a particular
		message. In this case, the <code>Related Help ...</code> button
		will be enabled. Clicking this button will take you to the
		relevant help page.</p>
	<p>Alternatively you may <a href="contact.html">contact Blue Prism
		for support</a>.</p>

	<h5>Automatic Repair</h5>
	<p>Results are classed in the list as repairable and non-repairable.
		Non-repairable indicates that the error must be fixed by a
		human; repairable indicates that Blue Prism can automatically
		fix the error.</p>
	
	<p>In the event that one or more of the errors is repairable, the
		<code>Repair All</code> button will be enabled. On clicking the
		button, all possible errors which can be repaired (as indicated
		in the <code>Repairable</code> column) will be repaired.</p>
		
	<h5>Inclusion of Business Objects</h5>
	<p>When viewing a process which uses business objects which have not
		yet been installed, a large number of results will clutter the
		list with errors about missing business objects. To exclude
		these errors, remove the checkmark from the box labelled <code>
		Include Business Objects</code>.</p>

	<h5>Go To Stage</h5>
	<p>The <code>Go To Stage</code> button takes you to the relevant
		stage, if such a stage exists. For example, if a stage is
		missing an out-bound link, the button will take you to the stage
		which is missing a link. If the error is not related to a stage
		(eg a page exists which is never used), then the button will
		have no effect.</p>
