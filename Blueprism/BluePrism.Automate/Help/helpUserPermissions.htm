    <h3>Blue Prism's Powerful User Permissions Control</h3>

    <p>Blue Prism provides a high level of control to system administrators wishing to limit the
    actions that may be performed by ordinary users. Indeed, in many parts of Blue Prism, an
    administrator may specify not only which sections of the system a user may access, but may
    specify precisely which buttons a user may press within that section.</p>

    <h3>Setting a User's Permissions</h3>

    <p>A user with permission to access <a href="frmSystemManager">System Manager</a> may set the
    roles of another user from the "Users" pane. This is achieved by selecting a user from the
    listview and clicking 'Edit user Settings' on the right. Once within the user settings form,
    permissions may be assigned to a user by navigating to the 'Permissions' tab and filling the
    checkboxes beside specific actions in the tree-view.</p>

    <h3>Use of Roles to Set Permissions</h3>

    <p>When a <a href="frmManageRoles.htm">Blue Prism Role</a> exists, a user may be assigned
    permissions conveniently simply by filling the checkboxes beside entries in the list of roles
    on the left hand side. This will automatically fill the checkboxes beside the actions contained
    in that role. This feature is especially convenient when setting the permissions of many users
    one after the other. For information about how to create custom roles, see
    <a href="frmManageRoles.htm">Blue Prism Roles</a>.</p>
