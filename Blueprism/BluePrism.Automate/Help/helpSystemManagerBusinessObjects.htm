    <h3>Business Objects</h3>

    <p>The business objects view shows a list of all available objects, displayed in their object
    groups.</p>

	<a name="Retirement" id="Retirement"></a>
    <h3>Business Object Retirement</h3>

    <p>Should an object no longer be of use, or should you wish to prevent it from being used
    temporarily, you may retire it by dragging and dropping it from the list at
    the top, into the lower list labelled &quot;Retired Processes&quot;. Retired objects can not be called
    from another process or business object.</p>

    <p>Retired objects will not be available for editing, viewing, exporting etc from the
    Object Studio Menu.</p>

    <p>This operation may be reversed by dragging it back from the lower list to the original list;
    the effect is immediate.</p>
