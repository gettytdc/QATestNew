	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>
		Java automation provides a series of specialised techniques for
		interfacing with applications written in the
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">Java programming
		Language</a>. To take advantage of these features, you should specify
		that your application is of type Java when running the 
		<a href="frmApplicationDefinitionCreate.htm">Application Modeller
		Wizard</a>. Alternatively, Java integration techniques are also
		available from within <a href="helpBrowserAutomation.htm">browser applications</a>
		when the <a href="helpApplicationParameters.htm#UseJavaInBrowser">
		appropriate application parameter</a> is selected in the Application Modeller Wizard.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Requirements and Installation</h3>
	<p>
		Java Automation requires the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jab-2-0-2-download-354311.html">
		Java Access Bridge</a> to be installed. At the time of writing, the latest version available separately
		is 2.0.2. The most recent versions of the JRE include the Access Bridge as standard.
	</p>
	<p>	Blue Prism supports JAB versions 2.0.0 and 2.0.2 and beyond.  Version 2.0.1 has a flaw causes issues working
		with Blue Prism, so avoid using this version.
	<p>
		Please consult the <a href="helpJABInstallation.htm">Java Access Bridge Installation Guide</a> for
		details of how to install the Java Access Bridge for use with Blue Prism.
	</p>
		
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>
		Java applications are accessed in the same way as any other application
		in <a href="helpObjectStudio.htm">Object Studio</a>, using the spy tool
		from the <a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm">Application Modeller</a>.
		See the <a href="attributes-java.htm">list of java attributes</a>
		returned by the spy tool for more information about identifying elements
		within your target application.
	<ul>
	<li>
		Customers using a 32-bit operating system are able to use Java access bridge 2.0.0 or higher and applications can be set to launch in embedded or external 32-bit mode
	</li>	
	<li>
		Customers wishing to utilise 64 bit operating systems must use Java access bridge 2.0.2 or higher
	</li>
	<li>
		Business Objects that model 64-bit Java applications must be set to “External 64-bit” mode
	</li>
	</ul>	
	<h3>Limitations</h3>
	<p>
		Sun's Java Access Bridge has limited support for version 1.3.x of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE). In particular
		text cannot be written directly to an edit field. However there are workarounds for each 
		limitation, meaning that Java Automation continues to be a valuable tool for JRE 1.3.
		See also <a href="helpTopicsByNumber.htm#Topic32808">help topic 32808</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Java Access Bridge does not allow interaction with modal dialogs. This fact is documented
		on Sun's <a href="http://archives.java.sun.com/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0801&L=JAVA-ACCESS&T=0&F=&S=&X=214FCF472E74019119&P=754">mailing list</a>.
		However, Blue Prism provides several other tools which allow interaction with modal dialogs,
		including bitmap recognition, font recognition, and the use of regions for basic user interaction
		(such as clicking of the mouse).

	<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
	<p>There are <a href="troubleshooting-jab.html">troubleshooting tips</a> available.</p>

	<h3>Performance Tips</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>When using 'descendtree' mode, significant performance gains can be achieved by using the AncestorCount, MatchIndex
		and MatchReverse identifiers to limit the scope of a query.</li>
	</ul>
