    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
		Process alerts allow users to monitor the progress of running sessions,
		without the need to continually monitor the display in
		<a href="frmControlRoom.htm">Control Room</a>. Interested parties can
		receive information about sessions alerting them to changes in the session status
		(such as when the session begins to run, when it completes, and, when it fails).
	</p>
	<p>
		Designers of Blue Prism Process <a href="helpFlowCharts.htm">
		flow charts</a> can create custom alert notifications by adding an
		<a href="frmStagePropertiesAlert.htm">Alert Stage</a> to the flow diagram.
		This allows alerts subscribers to receive custom notifications such as 
		&quot;New case batch downloaded; beginning processing on case 1 of 300&quot;.
		The content of such messages is based on the data available in the process,
		and may be changed dynamically, using a <a href="helpCalculationsandDecisions.htm">
		Blue Prism Expression</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Alerts Customisation</h3>
	<p>
		Different users can choose to subscribe to alerts for different processes,
		according to their interests. They can also filter the types of message that
		they wish to receive (for example if they are only interested in knowing when
		a session has completed then they can choose to filter out all other alert types).
		Several user interface options are available, and each user may choose their
		preferred format independently of all other users. Users change their preferences
		by editing their <a href="frmAlertConfig.htm">Alerts configuration</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>Alert Monitoring</h3>
    <p>
		Process alerts can be monitored from the main Blue Prism window, or by
		running Blue Prism in the background. When a user logs
		into Blue Prism, alert monitoring will also start (if the user has subscribed to process
		alerts) and an icon will appear in the Windows taskbar. When the user logs out, the 
		user will have the option to keeping monitoring running. To run Blue Prism in the background,
		use the command line option as described below.
	</p>
    
    <h3>Command Line</h3>
    <p>
		Process alert monitoring can be started from the command line using the following syntax.
	</p>
    <pre>
		Automate /alerts /user <i>myname mypassword</i>
	</pre>
	<p>
		This option will create a taskbar icon to indicate that Blue Prism is running in the background.
		The icon features a menu which allows the user to configure their alert settings and to make 
		the main Blue Prism window visible, if desired.
	</p>
