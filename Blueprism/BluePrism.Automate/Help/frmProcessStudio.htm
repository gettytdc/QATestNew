  <h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>Studio is the design area of Blue Prism - it is where processes and objects are created, modified
	and undergo initial testing before <a href="frmStagePropertiesProcessInfo.htm#Publishing">published</a>
	to be used in <a href="frmControlRoom.htm">Control Room</a>.</p>

	<p>Using Process Studio is simple - a drag and drop interface allows process flows to be
	quickly and easily implemented using the resources deployed on the current machine.</p>

  <p>The Studio tab displays the existing processes and objects organised into their groups in
  a tree and list view control. Selecting a group in the tree shows the members of that group
  in a list on the right, whereas selecting a process (or object) in the tree shows it's
  version history. Options are available via the right-click context menu.</p>

  <p>A padlock icon on a group signifies that the group has restricted permissions. These permissions can be viewed by selecting the option to Manage Permissions via the context menu. Setting permissions on a group requires the user to be assigned a role that has been granted permissions to Manage Permissions</p>

	<h3><a href="frmProcessCreate.htm">Create a new process</a></h3>

	<p>A step-by-step guide to creating a new business process from scratch. You will be guided
	through the initial steps required to identify your new process before moving to Process Studio
	to start work.</p>

	<h3><a href="frmProcessEdit.htm">Edit an existing process</a></h3>

	<p>Existing processes are presented for selection - once chosen, the process can be edited,
	tested and saved in Process Studio.</p>

	<h3><a href="frmProcessClone.htm">Clone an existing process</a></h3>

	<p>A rapid and simple way to create a new process based on an existing process or template -
	the clone option will take a process already saved, ask for a new name and duplicate it before
	moving to Process Studio with the process loaded.</p>

	<h3><a href="frmProcessDelete.htm">Delete a process</a></h3>

	<p>Delete an existing process from the database.</p>
