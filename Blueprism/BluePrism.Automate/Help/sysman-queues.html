	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p><a href="helpQueues.htm">Work Queues</a> are managed from the
	<code>Workflow</code> section of <a href="frmSystemManager.htm">
	System Manager</a>. This includes creating, deleting, renaming and
	configuring queues.</p>
	
	<h3>Managing Queues</h3>
	<p>A list of queues is displayed in the left hand list. The details
	of the selected queue are displayed on the right hand side.</p>
	<dl class="bulleted">
	  <dt>Creating a new Queue</dt>
	  <dd>Click the <code>New</code> button, and use the panel on the
		right to give your queue a name and configure the remaining
		details.</dd>
		
		<dt>Deleting a Queue</dt>
		<dd>Select the Queue of interest in the left hand list, and
		use the <code>Delete</code> button. Only queues which are empty
		may be deleted. You should first ensure that all items in the
		queue have been worked (or manually marked with an exception),
		and then deleted from the queue.</dd>
		
		<dt>Renaming a Queue</dt>
		<dd>Select the Queue of interest in the left hand list, and edit
		the name on the right hand side. Click <code>Apply</code> to
		finalise your change.</dd>
		
		<dt>Changing a Queue's Status</dt>
		<dd>You may <code>pause</code> a queue using the link displayed
		on the right hand side. A paused queue appears empty to
		processes which attempt to select cases from it. A paused queue
		can be resumed at any time afterwards.</dd>
		<dd>Ensure that you have selected the correct queue on the left
		before performing this action.</dd>
		
		<dt>Configuring the Key Field</dt>
		<dd>Items are entered into a queue using a process studio <a
		href="helpCollections.htm">collection</a>. Of the fields in this
		collection, one of them may be used as the <code>key</code> for
		each item. The key is used to identify items when <a
		href="control-queues.html">queue activity</a> is monitored from
		Control Room. For example, if you are updating bank accounts in
		a list, then you may wish to use the account number as the key
		field.</dd>
		<dd>You do not have to set a key field if this is not desirable.
		This may apply, for instance, in cases where the information
		being worked on is confidential.</dd>
		
		<dt>Setting a Maximum Number of Attempts</dt>
		<dd>A case may be selected for working, partly updated and not
		completed. It will then be picked for working from the queue
		again at a later stage. The value you enter here places a limit
		on the number of times this will be allowed to happen. Once this
		limit is reached, the case will automatically be marked as an
		exception.</dd>
		<dd>To change the <code>Maximum Attempts</code> setting, select
		the queue of interest in the left hand list, and edit the value
		on the right hand side. Click <code>Apply</code> to finalise
		your change.</dd>
		
		<dt>Setting the encrypter / decrypter</dt>
		<dd>The data held by each work item is stored in plain text on
		the database by default. The queue can be configured to encrypt
		the data automatically when it is saved to the queue, and
		decrypt it automatically when it is retrieved from the queue.
		</dd>
		<dd>To enable encryption on a queue, an <a href="helpencryption.htm">
		Encryption Scheme</a> must be	configured for the current environment.</dd>
		<dd>To change the encryption scheme or disable encryption,
		select the queue in the left of the window, and use the checkbox
		and drop down list to choose the encryption state of the queue.
		</dd>
		<dd>If the key for the selected scheme cannot be found in the server
		then it will be appended with <code>Unresolved Key</code> and, as such,
		any work item operations in this queue are likely to fail.</dd>
		<dd>Like the other queue configurations, changes are not saved
		until the <code>Apply</code> button is pressed.</dd>

        <dt>Configuring an Active Queue</dt>
        <dd>A queue can be configured to be 'active', meaning that it
        has a process and a resource group assigned to it, giving it
        the knowledge necessary to be able to process its items.</dd>
        <dd>To make a queue active, tick the <code>Active Queue</code>
        checkbox. The assignation fields will be enabled, and the
        process and resource group must be selected before the changes
        can be saved.</dd>
        <dd>Note that a resource group must exist before an active
        queue can be created.</dd>
