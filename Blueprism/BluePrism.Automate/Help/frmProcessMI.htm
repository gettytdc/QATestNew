    <h3>Process Management Information</h3>

    <p>
		The Process MI form is used to analyse previous sessions of a process. Session log data is
		extracted from the database and overlaid on the process diagram. Here, &quot;MI&quot; stands
		for &quot;Management Information.&quot;
    </p>

	<h5 class="bold">Using the Process MI Form</h5>
    <p>
		The top half of the form is used to search for sessions. Select one or more Resources, enter
		a Start Date and an End Date and then press the Search button. Blue Prism will then display a
		list of sessions that were run on those Resources between those dates
	</p>

    <p>
		The bottom half of the form is used to select the parts of the process to analyse. A list of
		Action, Calculation and Decision stages is displayed on the left. Tick the parts of the process
		to be included in the analysis and press the Analyse button. Blue Prism will then extract session
		data for the selected stages and display it on the process diagram. Once complete the analysis
		can be saved in a text file.
	</p>

    <p>
		Note that the analysis may take time depending on the quantity of session data in the Blue Prism
		database. You may reduce the time necessary by reducing the number of sessions and stages
		for which you desire an analysis.
