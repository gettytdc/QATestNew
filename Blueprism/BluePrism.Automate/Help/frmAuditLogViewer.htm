    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
		Blue Prism provides rigorous auditing features which record the actions
		of users. All important changes performed by a user
		are recorded in a log file for later inspection.
	</p>
	<p>
		Examples of actions recorded include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Logging into Blue Prism</li>
		<li>Running a process</li>
		<li>Deleting a process</li>
		<li>Changing <a href="helpUserPermissions.htm">user permissions</a></li>
		<li>Changing a user's name, or any other part of a user's configuration</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Individual revisions to processes are also recorded, and these changes may
		be tracked over time using the <a href="frmProcessComparison.htm">process
		history tool</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Accessing the Audit Log</h3>
	<p>
		The audit log is accessed via <a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a>,
		under the section labelled &quot;logs&quot;. Under the &quot;Audit Logs&quot; tab,
		a list of dates is displayed for which audit log data is available.
	</p>
	<p>
		To view the log data for a set of dates, select all dates of interest and click
		&quot;View Log&quot;. A form will pop up which displays the requested data.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Using the Log Viewer</h3>
	<h5 class="bold">Understanding the Table Columns</h5>
	<p>
		The log viewer consists of a table containing a number of columns. These columns
		record the date and time of each event, the user involved (if any), the process
		involved (if any), etc. Note that since not every action recorded affects a process,
		the &quot;Target Process&quot; column will not always contain a value. Similarly,
		the other columns may also contain blank values.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class="bold">Avoiding Naming Confusion</h5>
	<p>
		Where a user or process is involved in an audit record (ie a row in the table),
		the current name of the user will be displayed and not the name of the user as it was at the time. For 
		example, if the user &quot;John Smith&quot; deleted a process and subsequently
		had his username changed to &quot;James Brown&quot;, the name &quot;James Brown&quot;
		would appear in the table, rather than the name of the user as it was at the time
		the action took place (ie &quot;John Smith&quot;).
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that further confusion may arise if a new user was since added to the system
		who coincidentally had the name &quot;John Smith&quot;, matching the former name
		of the existing user &quot;James Brown&quot;.
	</p>
	<p>
		While seemingly confusing, this feature simplifies the log data greatly, since
		any name read from the log immediately identifies the user/process/resource pc
		in question; it eliminates the need to track back through the log and work out
		which user had which name at which time. This advantage is especially great on
		a system with a large number of users/processes, and which has a history stretching
		back for many years.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class="bold">Searching the log</h5>
	<p>
		The log search features (such as keyword finding, highlighting and
		<a href="helpWildcardsAndRegex.htm">wildcards and regex searching</a> work
		exactly as those for the <a href="frmLogsViewer.htm">session log viewer</a>.
