	</div>
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>When a task is selected in the schedule manager tree, its details
	are displayed in the right hand pane of the Blue Prism client.</p>
	<p>From here, a task can be configured to run a number of different
	processes on resources, and specify subsequent tasks to pass control
	to depending on the outcome of those processes when executed.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<h3 id="create-task">Creating a task</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-task-new.png"
			alt="Creating a task"/>
	</div>
	<p>A task is created by right-clicking on the appropriate schedule
	element in the schedule	manager tree and selecting "New Task".</p>
	<p>A new task, populated with default values, will be created and
	automatically selected in the schedule manager tree.</p>
	<p>When a schedule is first created, an initial task will be created
	at the same time.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>

	<h4 id="initial-task">Setting the task execution order</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-task-next.png"
			alt="Configuring a task"/>
	</div>
	<p>See <a href="helpSchedulesUI.htm#initial-task">Setting the
	schedule's initial task</a> for specifying which task should be
	executed first when a schedule is activated.</p>
	<p>The task to be executed after this task has completed
	successfully can be specified by selecting the appropriate task from
	the "On Complete" drop down. A value of "Stop" indicates that the
	schedule should complete after this task has completed.</p>
	<p>The task to be executed after this task has been terminated can
	be specified by selecting the appropriate task from the "On
	Exception" drop down. A value of "Abort" indicates that the schedule
	should terminate after this has terminated.</p>

	<h4 id="task-sessions">Session Failure Detection</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-task-failfast.png"
			alt="Fast-failing a task"/>
	</div>
	<p>By default, a task is configured to 'fail fast', ie. to
	immediately terminate the task if any sessions fail to start or
	terminate due to an exception. This can be overridden by unticking
	the <code>Fail fast on any errors</code> checkbox.</p>
	<p>Note that detecting a task failure works differently when fail
	fast is enabled compared to when it is not.</p>
	<ul class="image-inlined">
	<li>If a task is set to fail fast, a task is terminated when any
	errors in any of the sessions occur - eg. if a resource couldn't be
	contacted or was too busy to create a session, or if a session
	raised an exception and terminated abnormally.</li>
	<li>If a task is set <em>not</em> to fail fast, a task is only
	terminated if an error occurs in <em>all</em> of its sessions - and
	that task termination only takes place when the last running session
	is detected to have failed.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4 id="task-sessions">Maintaining scheduled sessions</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-task-dragging.png"
			alt="Creating a session"/>
	</div>
	<p>When a task is executed, all sessions defined within it will be
	run concurrently.</p>
	
	<p>There are no restrictions on sessions within a task. For example,
	multiple processes can be specified to run on the same resource. If
	such processes are exclusive, the task will be terminated due to the
	fact that the resource is too busy to run anything other than the
	first process.</p>	
	
	<h5 id="create-session">Creating a session</h5>
	<p>A scheduled session is created when a published process is
	dragged onto a resource, or vice versa.</p>
	<p>Once a session has been created, it will be listed in the
	'Scheduled Sessions' list.</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-startparams.png"
			alt="Setting start parameters"/>
	</div>
	<h5 id="process-params">Setting process parameters</h5>
	<p>If a process in a session requires startup parameters, they can
	be configured by right clicking the appropriate session and
	selecting "Startup Parameters" from the context menu.</p>
	<p>See the <a href="frmStartParams.htm">Start parameters help topic
	</a> for further information on configuring start parameters.</p>
	
	<h5 id="Post Completion Delay">Post Completion Delay</h5>
	<p>Adds a delay of between 0 and 1500 seconds to the end of a
	scheduled task before allowing the next task in the schedule to commence.</p>
	
	<h5 id="delete-session">Deleting a session</h5>
	<p>Right-clicking the session and selecting "Delete" will cause the
	session to be removed from the task.</p>
	
	
	<h3 id="save-task">Saving a task</h3>
	<p>A task cannot be saved directly - changes to a task implicitly
	cause changes in its parent schedule, so in order to save a task,
	its schedule must be saved.</p>
	<p>See the <a href="helpSchedulesUI.htm#save-schedule">Saving a
	schedule</a> help topic for further help in saving a schedule.</p>
	
	<h3 id="copy-paste-task">Copying and pasting a task</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-task-copy.png"
			alt="Copying a task"/>
	</div>
	<p>A task can copied and pasted either to its parent schedule
	(cloning the task), or to a different schedule altogether.</p>
	<p>Due to the way this is implemented, copying and pasting can only
	be performed within a single instance of the Blue Prism application
	- ie. it cannot be copied from one running application and pasted
	into another.</p>
	<p>A task is copied by right-clicking it and selecting 'Copy'</p>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-task-paste.png" alt="Pasting a task"/>
	</div>
	<p>Once copied, it can be pasted into a schedule by right-clicking
	the target schedule in the schedule manager tree and selecting
	'Paste'.</p>
	<p>Note that this does not use the system clipboard and, as such, is
	unaffected by other cutting / copying operations. This also means
	that the copied task does not exist outside of the currently
	executing schedule manager.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<h3 id="delete-task">Deleting a task</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-task-delete.png"
			alt="Deleting a task"/>
	</div>
	<p>A task can be deleted by right-clicking it in the schedule
	manager tree and selecting 'Delete'.</p>
	<p>Note that any references to the task by another task (as its next
	task in an "On Complete" or "On Exception" drop down) or by the
	schedule (as its "Initial Task") will be reset to defaults when the
	task is deleted.</p>
