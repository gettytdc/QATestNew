    <h3>Creating a new Database</h3>
		<div class="indented">
		<h4>1. Set Connection Information</h4>
		<p>
			First visit the <a href="helpConnections.htm">Database Connections Form</a> to enter details of the server on
			which you would like to create a database, and to enter the name that the new database should take.
		</p>
		
		<h4>2. Ensure that the database is not in use</h4>
		<p>
			Blue Prism will create a database with the name supplied in the connections form (or modify an existing database
			sharing that name, if such a database already exists). If a database with that name does already exist then it
			is important to ensure that it is not in use by another application. This includes other instances of Blue Prism running on other
			resource PCs. Please ensure that no other application is currently using the database before proceeding.
		</p>
		
		<h4>3. Choose whether to purge any existing database</h4>
		<p>
			If a database with the specified name already exists, you may either modify the existing instance or you may purge
			(ie permanently and thoroughly delete) the existing database and create a new database of the same name in its
			place. The latter is the recommended option.
		</p>
		<p>
			The former option may be useful if the database username under which Blue Prism runs does not have permission to
			DROP and CREATE databases. If no database already exists with the specified name then choosing the &quot;purge&quot;
			option will have no effect.
		</p>
		
		<h4>4. Choose Authentication Method</h4>
		<p> A choice of standard Blue Prism Authentication, or <a href="helpSingleSignon.htm">Single Sign-on</a>
		Authentication exists. Single Sign-on is usually only used by large organisations with a well managed
		network. This option will require the assistance of a network administrator to configure Microsoft
		Active Directory options.</p>
		<p>If unsure, choose the default option of Blue Prism Authentication.</p>
		
		<h4>5. Create the Database</h4>
		<p>
			From the main menu of Blue Prism, choose the &quot;Create Database&quot; option. It is necessary to be signed
			out of Blue Prism in order to do this. On the form that pops up, confirm the password given in the connections dialog,
			click &quot;OK&quot; and wait. Once the database has been created you will receive a confirmation message.
			From this point forward you may sign in to the new database as described below.
		</p>
		
		<h4>6. Sign in</h4>
		<p>If you successfully configured Single Sign-on then you should be signed in automatically. If you have trouble,
		check your settings (including group Active Directory group membership, etc) and try again. Note that Active Directory
		changes may not take effect until you log off and log on again.</p>
		<p>
			If you are using Blue Prism authentication then you may sign in to the new database using the
			username &quot;admin&quot; and the password &quot;admin&quot;.
			It is highly recommended that you change the password on this administrator account in order to prevent unwanted 
			access.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of your first tasks after signing in may be to:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="helpSystemManUsers.htm">Create user accounts</a> for other users of the system.</li>
			<li><a href="helpUserPermissions.htm">Manage user roles and permissions</a> for the newly created users. This is particularly relevant
			if you are using Single Sign-on.</li>
			<li><a href="relman-import-release.html">Import a process/release</a> &mdash; either as a learning example or a functioning entity for use against your systems.</li>
		</ul>
