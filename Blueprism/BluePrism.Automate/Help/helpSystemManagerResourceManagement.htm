    <h3>Resource Management</h3>

    <p>The Resource Management tab allows you to retire and un-retire Resource PCs, and to configure
	diagnostics settings for them.</p>

    <h3>Retirement</h3>

    <p>Should a resource no longer be of use, or should you wish to prevent it from being used
    temporarily, you may retire a resource by dragging and dropping it from the list of resources
    at the top, into the lower list labelled &quot;Retired Resources&quot;.</p>

    <p>This operation may be reversed by dragging it back from the lower list to the original list;
    the effect is immediate.</p>

    <h3>Diagnostics</h3>

    <p>By right-clicking any number of active Resource PC and choosing 'Logging Level' from the menu, you
    can configure diagnostics options for those Resource PCs. The available options are:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Log Overriding</b> - usually this is set to 'Default', and logging
		by processes running on the Resource PC is inhibited according to the process design (see
		<a href="frmProcess.htm">Stage Logging</a>).
		However, occasionally it may be useful to override this log inhibiting and have additional
		logging. By selecting 'All stages', any log inhibiting defined in a process
		is ignored and all stages are logged. This will result in very verbose logs, but may be
		useful in diagnosing problems. An intermediate option, 'Key stages', is also
		available - this overrides only on stages such as Code Stages, Navigate, Read, Write,
		Wait and Action/Subprocess calls.</li>
		
		<li><b>Log Memory Statistics</b> - if enabled, all process log entries are accompanied
		by a record of how much memory (Working Set) was in use by the main Blue Prism executable
		at the time. Additionally, if the logged action refers to a target application, the
		identity and memory usage of that target application is also recorded.</li>
		
		<li><b>Include Memory Cleanup</b> - enabling this
		may produce more useful figures when diagnosing suspected memory leak issues.</li>

		<li><b>Log Web Service Communication</b> - enabling this causes low-level web service
		communication to be logged - specifically, SOAP messages are logged in full detail.
		For consumed web services, the information is logged as part of the corresponding
		session log. For exposed web services, it is logged in the event log for the relevant
		Resource PC.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If a Resource PC is online when its diagnostics settings are changed, it does not need
	to be restarted for the new settings to take effect. It will pick up and begin using the
	modified settings within two minutes at the most.</p>

    <h3>Reset FQDN</h3>

    <p>By right-clicking any number of active Resource PCs and choosing 'Reset FQDN' the recorded FQDN
    for those Resources can be reset. See the <a href="helpSystemManagerSettings.htm#registration">
	    registration settings</a> for more details. This option is only available when in
    'Register using machine (short) name, communicate using FQDN' mode.</p>

    <h3>Permissions</h3>

	<p>The following permissions can be used to control what particular users can do with Resources
		within the Resource Management tab and Control Room. Refer to
     <a href="helpUserPermissions.htm">User Permissions</a> for more information about how
     permissions are assigned to users through <a href="frmManageRoles.htm">User Roles.</a></p>
