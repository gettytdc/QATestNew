    <h3>View an Existing Process</h3>

    <p>A quick and easy way to view an existing process is by using the View Process wizard, from
    the Process Studio main menu. Follow the steps below as indicated by the numbered options on
    screen.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Locate a process</h3>

        <p>A list of existing processes from the database is presented with name, version and
        description details listed. The information in the box can be sorted according to each
        column by clicking the appropriate heading.</p>

        <p>To select a process to view, simply highlight the entry required using the mouse.</p>

        <h3><a href="frmProcess.htm">2. Continue to Process Studio</a></h3>

        <p>Once you have completed step 1 clicking OK will open the selected process and progress
        to Process Studio with your process loaded onto the canvas. You will be able to view all
        aspects of the process but will not be able to modify it in any meaningful way.</p>
