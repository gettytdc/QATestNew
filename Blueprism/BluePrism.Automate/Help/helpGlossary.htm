    <h5 class="bold">Activate (Window)</h5>
    <p>Activating a window means making it the main window on the desktop by bringing it to the
    foreground. The activated window is the window which receives keyboard input; it is usually displayed
    with a title bar in full colour, whereas all other windows are displayed with a grey title bar.</p>
    
    
    <div id="Focus" name="Focus" />
    <h5 class="bold">Focus (Window or Element)</h5>
    <p>The focused element is the element which receives keyboard input for a particular application.
    When text fields are focused they usually contain a blinking cursor, known as the
    <a href="#Caret">caret</a>; other elements such as buttons are usually surrounded by a
    dotted rectangle when they have focus. Focus may be shifted from one element to another by
    pressing the tab key.</p>
    <p>Sometimes the word focus is used in relation to a window. In such cases, the word <a href="#Activate">activate</a>
    should be used instead, though the meaning is very similar.</p>
