	<h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
	<span class="emphasis">Dynamic Data Exchange</span> is a Microsoft technology supported
	by a number of legacy applications. This mechanism has existed since Windows version 3.1.</p>
	
	<p>DDE provides an additional mechanism for reading and writing data
	to target applications, as an alternative to interfacing with the presentation layer.</p>
	
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>DDE data fields are identified using three strings: the <span class="emphasis">server</span> name,
	the <span class="emphasis">topic</span> name and the <span class="emphasis">item</span> name. It is these
	three pieces of information that make up the attributes of a DDE Element.</p>
	
	<p>To create a DDE Element, right-click an existing element in the
	<a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#structure">Application Modeller tree</a>, and
	choose &quot;Insert new DDE Element&quot;. You will then have to populate the three attributes
	according to your target application's definitions for the item of interest.</p>
	
	<p>To see a list of available DDE servers, topics and items, right-click the Application Modeller
	tree and choose &quot;View list of DDE items&quot;.</p>
	
	<h3>Data Types</h3>
	<p>All data sent to/from DDE by Blue Prism is treated as text. You may override how data is treated (once
	read from your target application) by setting a new data type against the element in Application Modeller.
	Valid options are &quot;Date&quot;, &quot;DateTime&quot;, &quot;Flag&quot;, &quot;Number&quot;, &quot;Text&quot;,
&quot;Time&quot; and &quot;TimeSpan&quot;.</p>
