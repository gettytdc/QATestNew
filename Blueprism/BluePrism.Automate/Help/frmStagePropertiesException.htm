    <h3>Exception Stage</h3>
	<p>
		The exception stage allows the process to report exceptions and stop execution.
		For an overview of exceptions see: <a href="helpExceptions.htm"> Exceptions Help</a>
	</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Enter a name</h3>

        <p>The name that you enter identifies the exception, it will be displayed on the process
        diagram.</p>

        <h3>2. Enter a description</h3>

        <p>The additional description field allows a lengthier narrative to be entered.</p>

        <h3>3. Enter an Exception Type</h3>
		
		<p>The Exception type can be used to generalise the cause of the exception.
		<ul>
		<li>Choose an existing exception type from the dropdown.</li>
		<li>Create a new exception type by entering text.</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		
	<h3>4. Enter Exception Detail</h3>

        <p>The Exception detail can be used to get any additional values from the process. 
		<ul>
		<li>The Exception detail can be any valid Blue Prism expression. See <a href="helpCalculationsAndDecisions.htm">Calculations and Decisions</a>.</li>
		<li>If you just need some text remember to enclose the text in quote marks.</li>
		</ul>
        </p>

        <h3>5. Preserve type and detail of current exception</h3>

	<p>This allows the type and detail of the exception, that would otherwise have
	to be captured using the ExceptionType() and ExceptionDetail() expressions, to
        be reused in the current exception. This can be used for example to perform
	some cleanup but allow the exception to still propagate to additional recovery
        stages.</p>

	<h3>6. Save screen capture</h3>

	<p>This will take an image of the screen when the exception occours, and store
	it in the Blue Prism database. The screen capture feature must be enabled in the
	<a href="sysman-settings.html">system settings</a> for the checkbox to take any
	effect. Only the latest screen capture will be stored for any runtime resource.
	Only processes running in control room will create screen captures. During
	debugging of the process screen captures are not taken but a message will be
	logged to indicate when a screen capture would have been made. </p>
