	</div>

	<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
	<p>When an application has a complicated user interface containing
	many user interface elements, it can take Blue Prism a long time to find
	the element with in the Application Model. There are a numer of attributes
	that effect the way in which the search is performed and in some cases
	can speed up the search time.</a>.
	</p>
	<h3 id="intro">Optimisation Attributes</h3>
	<dl class="listplease bulleted">
		<dt>Ancestor Count</dt>
		<dd>The ancestor count attribute is particularly useful in an tree like
		object model which includes Active Accessibility and Java. Within
		these models searches along the branches of the tree can be stopped
		short when we are about to descend deeper than the ancestor count.
		Ancestor count can be used for all application types but only provides
		optimisation in AA and Java. It should be used with care as the ancestor
		count may change as the model is updated. The HTML ancestor count attribute
		is known to change across IE versions so elements using the ancestor count
		may have to be re-spied when IE is upgraded.</dd>

		<dt>Match Index</dt>
		<dd>The match index attribute allows the search to stop as soon
		as the element Nth element is found. This should be used carefully
		because usually the search would continue looking for duplicate matches
		and thus eliminates an ambiguous match. It is also not very safe to assume
		that the elements will be found in the same order, and so the Nth element
		could potentially be a different element than that which was expected.</dd>

		<dt>Match Reverse</dt>
		<dd>The match reverse attribute simply changes the direction of
		the search, this can be useful if the element is at the end of the
		search list. The match reverse attribute is only relavent when used in
		combination wit the match index attribute.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h3>Browser Based Application Optimisations</h3>
		<h4>Paths</h4>
		<p>Matching against the Path attribute of an Element within a browser
		based application will be fast. Where the path attribute is constant
		it is most appropriate to use this attribute for matching.
		<h4>Element ID</h4>
		<p>When the path attribute is not a suitable attribute to match against
		the next best alternative is to match on Element ID. The Element ID is
		name that the web page developer may have added to an element. It is
		required to be unique and provides the ability for scripts within the web
		page to look up the element quickly.</p>
		<h4>Exclude HTC Components</h4>
		<p>Within the Application Modeller wizard there is an option to exclude HTC
		components. Turning this option on will improve performance. The only time
		this option should be left turned off is when the application being interfaced
		with uses HTC components.</p>
        <h4>Only interact with elements on the active browser tab</h4>
        <p>
        Within the Application Modeller wizard there is an option to only interact 
        with elements within the current tab. This option will provide more 
        consistent results and is turned on by default. When this option is turned 
        on you must switch to a different tab before interacting with it. Turning 
        this option off allows interaction with elements on tabs which are not 
        currently active but this can sometimes produce unexpected results.
