The test process/objects will test:
Start session
Wait
Write
Read
Sendkeys
End session


IBM Personal Communications needs to be installed. This is available under software kits.
The test object requires a host session called hostSHU.ws

A sample hostSHU.ws file is available within the QA project under \Processes\Mainframe\Host and must be copied to C:\Program Files\IBM\Personal Communications\private

The session needs to be configured so that the "Type of Host" is ANSII and the primary host is 127.0.0.1

The traceplayer RUN_mainframe.trc_GROOMED.BAT (in QA prjoject under Processes\Mainframe\SHU TracePlayer) must be started before the session. The Automate process will take care of this.
