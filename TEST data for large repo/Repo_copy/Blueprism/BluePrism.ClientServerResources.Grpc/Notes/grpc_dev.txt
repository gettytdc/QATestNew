Generating the proto file.
The proto file cannot be built on the build server because the build tools are out-of-date.  The following the workaround is required order to use grpc within Blueprism.

If you need to make changes to the grpc proto file.

1) Right click on the solution folder ClientServerResources and "Add->Existing Project" "BluePrism.ClientServerResources.Grpc.Proto".
2) Make changes to the proto file.  Example "instructionalConnection.proto".
3) Rebuild the project "instructionalConnection.proto" in "RELEASE" Mode!.
4) Navigate to the bin folder within the project "BluePrism.ClientServerResources.Grpc.Proto" 
5) Copy the files BluePrism.ClientServerResources.Grpc.Proto.dll and BluePrism.ClientServerResources.Grpc.Proto.pdb into {SolutionFolder}/Lib/gRpc
    5b) alternatively run 'CopyProto.ps1' in {SolutionFolder}/BluePrism.ClientServerResources.Grpc.Proto/
6) Remove the project "BluePrism.ClientServerResources.Grpc.Proto" from the solution.
7) Make sure to push the new proto dll's with your work.

The dll's within the lib directory are automatically linked into the relevant projects.

Certificate generation
To generate some test certificates, use the following command in git-bash

    openssl genrsa -out server.key
    openssl req -new -sha256 -key server.key -out server.csr
    openssl x509 -req -days 3650 -in server.csr -out server.crt -signkey server.key

    Information required: Company Name/FQDN = localhost
    Enter '.' (no quotes) for all other fields. 


This will generate 2 files, the certificate (server.crt) and the private key (server.key).  These can then be added to the CallbackConnection.config 

{
  "HostName": "localhost",
  "Port": 10000,
  "Mode": 2,
  "CertificateName": null,
  "SendTimeout": 60,
  "RecieveTimeout": 60,
  "CertificatePath" : "./certificate/server.crt",
  "KeyPath" : "./certificate/server.key"
}


"Mode" defines the security to use.
None = 0,
Certificate = 1,
Windows = 2,
Insecure = 3
