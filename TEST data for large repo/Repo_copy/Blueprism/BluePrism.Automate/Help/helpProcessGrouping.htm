	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Process grouping allows you to create associations between Blue Prism processes, according to
	the relationships you hold in your own head. The association does not change the function or behaviour
	of these processes - it merely provides you with the convenience of organising your processes in such
	a way as to make them easier to locate when browsing.</p>
	
	<p>A typical use of process grouping is to group processes according to the high-level Business Processes
	which use them. This helps to keep track of how many processes are in use, and whether the current
	configuration complies with the current Blue Prism <a href="licence.html">licence</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Creating Groups</h3>
	<p>Groups can be created and edited from the &quot;Processes&quot; section of System Manager.</p>
	
	<p>Groups are created in the right-hand list, using the &quot;New Group&quot; button. Newly created
	groups are given a name by default, and this can be customised by typing a name immediately after using the
	&quot;New Group&quot; button. Groups can be renamed again at a later stage using the context menu.</p>
	
	<p>Processes are added to groups by dragging and dropping them from left-to-right.
	A single process may belong to any number of groups. Drag and drop your processes of interest from
	left-to-right, dropping them onto the group(s) to which you which them to belong.</p>
	
	<p>Processes may be removed from a group using the &quot;Remove&quot; button, or using the appropriate
	context menu option. This has no effect on the process &mdash; the process is not deleted, and the process
	is not removed from any other group than the instance selected.</p>
	
	<p>Groups may be deleted using the &quot;Delete&quot; button, or using the appropriate
	context menu option. This has no effect on the processes contained in the group &mdash;
	the processes are not deleted.</p>
	
	<p>Changes to groups are not committed until you click &quot;Apply&quot;. This includes the creation,
	renaming and deletion of groups, as well as changes to group membership. To cancel any unwanted changes,
	simply navigate away from the screen without clicking &quot;Apply&quot;.</p>
