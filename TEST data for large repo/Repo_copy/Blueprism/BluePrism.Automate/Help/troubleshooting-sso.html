	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>This page provides some common issues and suggested resolutions
	for using the Single Sign On feature of Blue Prism</p>

	<h5>I can't sign on</h5>
	<p>If you believe that all of your settings, including user groups
	are correct, try logging off and logging on again - when a user is
	added to an Active Directory group, the change takes effect next
	time s/he logs on</p>
	
	<p>Ask your network administrator to check that you are a member of
	one of the Blue Prism user groups. A member of the Blue Prism
	Administrators group (as configured in the <a
	href="helpSingleSignonSettings.htm"> Single Sign-On Settings</a>)
	should be able to sign in. Check which Active Directory groups are
	mapped to the <a
	href="frmManageRoles.htm">Blue Prism Roles</a> in System Manager.
	You should be a member of at least one of these groups.</p>
	
	<h5>I receive an error message:</h5>
	<dl class="bulleted">
		<dt>The trust relationship between this workstation and the
			primary domain failed</dt>
		<dd>This error indicates a problem with your network's
			configuration. It can sometimes be a symptom of a disjointed
			namespace.</dd>
		
		<dt>The specified domain does not exist or cannot be contacted
			</dt>
		<dd>Sometimes a machine can appear to be a member of a domain,
			but badly configured. If this only happens from a specific
			machine, whereas other machines work without problems then
			this may well be the problem. In this case try leaving the
			domain and rejoining.</dd>
	</dl>
	
  <h5>I receive an information message:</h5>
  <dl class="bulleted">
    <dt>Unable to retrieve the members of Security Group <i>{Security
    Group Name}</i> because it contains members which are either Foreign Security
    Principals or have unresolved SIDs.</dt>
    <dd>Some Active Directory Security Groups (e.g. some built-in groups) present
    querying difficulties and therefore such configurations are not recommended.
    Whilst users from these groups will be able to sign-in with the correct
    permissions, some Blue Prism screens may not be able to accurately display
    membership information.</dd>
