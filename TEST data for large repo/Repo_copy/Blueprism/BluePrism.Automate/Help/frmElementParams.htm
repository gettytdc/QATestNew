    <h3>Element Parameters</h3>

    <p><a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#Elements">Application Elements</a> with attributes
    which have been made <a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#dynamic">dynamic</a> must have
    values supplied to those attributes at runtime, in order that the elements can be identified in the
    target application.</p>

    <h3>Using the form</h3>
    <p>
		The name and data type of the dynamic attributes are listed, with one attribute per row.
		A value must be supplied to each one in the form of an expression. This will often be as
		simple as supplying the value of a data item. In this case, the appropriate data item can
		simply be dragged from the data item tree. Since the value you supply is a Blue Prism expression,
		you must enclose any literal text strings in quotes.
    </p>
    <p>
		You may test the value explicitly for equality, or use a variety of other comparisons such as
		&quot;less than&quot; and &quot;greater than&quot; etc (for numbers), <a href="helpWildcardsAndRegex.htm">wildcard comparison</a>
		(for text) and &quot;not equal&quot; (for any data type) . 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Finding Occurrences of the Same Element</h3>
    <p>
		As you fill-in or amend these details, you may be curious to know where else
		the same element is used, so that you may update those occurrences in a 
		similar fashion.
	</p>
	<p>
		The <a href="helpProcessSearch.htm#ElementSearch">element search</a> feature
		is the best method of finding all such occurrences.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Tips</h3>
    <p>
		If you use the same information as dynamic parameter values in each and every stage properties
		form, you would be wise to put your expression into a <a href="frmStagePropertiesCalculation.htm">calculation stage</a>, and store the result in a 
		<a href="frmStagePropertiesData.htm">data item</a>. The data item should then be supplied in the place of your expression. This way, if ever you 
		need to amend your expression, you need only do so once (ie in the calculation stage) instead of in each
		and every properties form on an individual basis.
	</p>
	<p>
		You must be sure to think about when the data item will need to be refreshed (by running the calculation
		stage again), so that it contains the latest information. Where there are several dynamic parameters associated
		with an element, you may wish to group these expression data items into a <a href="helpCollections.htm">collection</a> for tidiness and
		to avoid confusion between data items.
