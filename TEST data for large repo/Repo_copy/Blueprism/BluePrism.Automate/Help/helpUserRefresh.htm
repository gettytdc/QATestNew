	<h3>Refreshing Users</h3>
        <p>The refresh user list feature is useful for installations with a
        <a href="helpSingleSignon.htm">Single Sign-on</a> configuration.
        Clicking the refresh user list link will update the list of users in
        <a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a> to include any new
        users who are members of the appropriate Active Directory user groups
        (as configured in the <a href="frmManageRoles.htm">user role management
        dialog</a>). Once users exist in Blue Prism, specific features can be
        configured against their profile, such as
        <a href="helpProcessAlerts.htm">process alerts.</a></p>

        <p>Any users who were previously registered with Blue Prism but have
        been deleted or deactivated in Active Directory will be marked as
        inactive. Inactive users do not initially appear in the user list but
        can be made visible by right clicking the users list and selecting show
        all users.</p>
