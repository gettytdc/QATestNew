    <h3>Overview</h3>
    
    <p>The System Manager module is where the Blue Prism installation can be maintained from an
    administrative perspective. Principally, System Manager allows the configuration of the various
    facets of the Blue Prism system, such as users and the assignment of roles, in addition to
    database activities, such as lock maintenance and the administration of log files and statistic
    data.</p>

    <p>System Manager also has a function which allows all users, processes, test scenarios and
    reports to be quickly viewed and maintained.</p>

    <p>The System Manager interface is activity based, whereby selecting an icon representing a
    system area will present information and wizards relating to that component.</p>

    <p>Selecting Users for example, will show all users currently configured and enable actions
    such as Create, Delete and Edit Users and also allow for the maintenance of Blue Prism Roles
    .</p>
