	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
	
	<p>Once a release has been created from a package, it cannot be
	recreated - only a new release can be produced from the current
	components in the environment.</p>
	
	<p>This wizard can be used to test whether any of the components
	defined in a package have changed since a given release file was
	created.</p>
	
	<p>It should be noted that just the act of saving a component can
	change it (arbitrarily ordered data may be differently ordered on a
	subsequent save, the component may include its last updated time,
	etc).</p>
	
	<p>For the above reason and for simplicity, only releases created
	from packages which exist on the current machine can be verified.
	</p>
	
	<p>Once a release file has been selected, this wizard will compare
	its contents against the current state of the components in the
	package defined in the current environment. Any discrepancies are
	then reported to the user.</p>
	
	<p>It can be initiated by choosing the <code>Verify Release</code>
	task in <a href="relman-ui.html">Release Manager</a>.</p>
	
	<h3 id="stages">Stages</h3>
	<p>The stages involved in verifying a release are the following:-
	</p>
	<dl class="listplease">
		<dt><a href="#file">Input File</a></dt>
		<dd>Choose the release file that you want to verify against
		the current environment.</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="#work">Parse and Compare</a></dt>
		<dd>Progress stage displayed while the wizard parses and
		compares the release</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="#report">Report</a></dt>
		<dd>A list of the differences between the specified release file
		and the current state of the package in the environment.</dd>
		<dd>Shows a label indicating that there are no differences if
		the release matches the current state of the package.</dd>
	</dl>

	<h4 id="name">Input File</h4>

	<h4 id="name">Parse and Compare</h4>

	<h4 id="name">Report</h4>
	<p>The differences between the specified release and the current
	environment are displayed here.</p>
	<p>The file is referenced by its release name, the current
	environment is referenced by the name 'Current Environment'.</p>
	<p>If there are no differences, a label is displayed indicating
	that fact.</p>
