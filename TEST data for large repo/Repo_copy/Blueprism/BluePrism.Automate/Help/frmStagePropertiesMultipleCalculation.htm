    <h3>Multiple Calculation Stage</h3>

    <p>The Multiple Calculation stage performs multiple calculations in sequence, but all within one stage.
	For further information on how to construct a valid expression see 
	<a href="helpCalculationsAndDecisions.htm">Calculations and Decisions.</a></p>

    <h5 class="bold">Properties Form</h5>

    <p>The Multiple Calculation properties form consists of a list with two columns, Expression and Result. The 
	Expression field allows you to enter an expression as free form text, or for advanced expression editing
	the Expression Edit Button can be pressed which pops up the standard Expression Editing Dialog. The 
	Result field allows you to enter the name of a Data Item. If the Data Item name you typed doesn't already
	exist the Create Data Item button can be pressed. To the right of the list there is a Data Item Treeview. Items
	can be dragged from this Treeview into the Expression field to form part of an expression as well as into
	the Result field.</p>

   <p>The order of the rows within the Multiple Calculation	stage signifies the order in which they will be 
	executed. You can move a row up or down using the buttons at the bottom of the form to change the execution
	order. The result of prior steps in the execution can be used in expressions in a following step.</p>
