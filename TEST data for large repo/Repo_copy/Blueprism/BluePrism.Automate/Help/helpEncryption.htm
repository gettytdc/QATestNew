  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>Blue Prism provides the facility to encrypt sensitive data held within the
  database, through user-definable encryption schemes maintained in the <code>Security</code>
  section of <a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a>. The following industry
  standard encryption methods are supported:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AES-256 AesCryptoService (256 bit)</li>
    <li>AES-256 RijndaelManaged (256 bit)</li>
    <li>Triple DES (192 bit)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Triple DES (192 bit) is provided for backwards compatibility. It is strongly recommended that new encryption schemes are not configured to use this method.</p>

  <p>The <code>Security - View Encryption Scheme Configuration</code> <a href="helpUserPermissions.htm">permission</a>
  is required in order to access this section. However, in order to create, edit or delete
  the schemes themselves the <code>Security - Manage Encryption Schemes</code> permission
  is required.</p>

  <h3>Managing Schemes</h3>
  <p>A summary of the existing encryption schemes is displayed showing name,
  encryption method, location of the key and a status indicating whether or not the
  scheme is available for selecting as a data encrypter (e.g. as the default encryption
  scheme or for work queues).</p>
  
 	<dl class="bulleted">
  <dt>Creating a new scheme</dt>
  <dd>Clicking the <code>New</code> link displays the <code>Define Encryption Scheme</code>
  form, where the scheme name and key location can be entered. By default new schemes
  are initialised as Unavailable, however checking the <code>Available</code> check box
  will make the scheme available for selecting as a data encrypter.</dd>
  <dd>Where the key is to be held on the Server, the <a href="helpBPServer.htm">configuration
  utility</a> should be used to assign a key to the scheme on each server in use. Where the key
  is to be held in the database, it should be entered here.</dd>

  <dt>Editing an existing scheme</dt>
  <dd>Clicking the <code>Edit</code> link displays the <code>Define Encryption Scheme</code>
  form with the existing scheme details populated. The key itself cannot be changed directly,
  however the location of the key can be changed and when doing this care must be taken to
  ensure that the key is transferred correctly otherwise previously encrypted data could be
  rendered unreadable.</dd>
  <dd>Note that schemes that have already been selected as data encrypters cannot be set to
  Unavailable.</dd>

  <dt>Deleting an existing scheme</dt>
  <dd>Clicking the <code>New</code> link will delete a scheme provided that it is not
  currently selected as a data encrypter and that there is no data on the database encrypted
  with it. Prior to deleting a scheme the following steps should be taken:
  <ul>
    <li>Ensure it is not selected as a data encrypter (e.g. as the default encryption scheme or for work queues)</li>
    <li>Edit the scheme and set it to Unavailable to prevent it from being re-selected</li>
    <li>Use the <a href="helpCommandLine.htm#reencryptdata">re-encrypt data</a> command line
    option to ensure that there is no remaining data encrypted by the key</li>
    <li>Delete the scheme</li>
    <li>Remove the key from any Server Key Stores (if applicable)</li>
  </ul>
  </dl>

	<dd>Note: If the key for a scheme cannot be found in the server
	then it will be appended with <code>Unresolved Key</code> and, as such,
	any attempted encryption/decryption operations using it are likely to fail.</dd>

  <h3>Default encryption scheme</h3>
  <p>Certain data (such as credentials and resource screen captures) must always be
  encrypted, therefore one of the defined schemes must be selected in this drop down
  list. For new installations this will be set to the default <code>Default Encryption Scheme</code>
  scheme created by the installer. However it will not be possible to create credentials
  or capture resource screenshots until a key is assigned to this scheme.</p>
