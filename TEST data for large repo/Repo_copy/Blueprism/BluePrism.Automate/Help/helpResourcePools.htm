	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Resource pools allow you to group Resources into arbitrary work units that can be used as though
	they were a single combined unit with all the resources of the individual machines that comprise the pool.</p>
	
	<p>A typical use of Resource pools is to group several machines into one unit, and run many foreground processes 
	on the pool allowing Blue Prism to choose machines in the pool which are available to run the requested processes.</p>
	
	<p>This can be particularly useful if one is less concerned about which machine a process will run on but wants to 
	guarantee that the process will be run, for example when used with command line scheduling options, or the built in 
	Process Scheduler</p>
	
	<h3>Creating Pools</h3>
	<p>Pools can be created and edited from the Resource Pools tab in the &quot;Resources&quot; section of System
	Manager.</p>
	
	<p>Pools are created in the right-hand list, using the &quot;New Pool&quot; button. Newly created pools are given
	a name by default, and this can be customised by typing a name immediately after using the &quot;New Pool&quot; 
	button. Pools cannot be renamed.</p>
	
	<p>Resources are added to pools by dragging and dropping them from left-to-right. A single resource may only
	belong to one pool. Drag and drop your Resources of interest from left-to-right, dropping them onto the pool
	to which you wish them to belong.</p>
	
	<p>Resources may be removed from a pool using the &quot;Remove from Pool&quot; button, or using the appropriate
	context menu option.</p>
	
	<p>Pools may be deleted using the &quot;Delete Pool&quot; button, or using the appropriate context menu option.
	Doing so will remove all the resources in the pool, and place them back in the list of available resources</p>
	
	<p>Changes to pools and the designation of resources to a pool are committed instantly</p>

	<h3>Control Room</h3>
	
	<p>In control room, pools appear just like any other resource pc. Processes can be dragged and dropped onto resource 
	pools in exactly the same way they can be dropped onto regular resources. One significant difference between resource
	pools and regular resource PCs is that the number of resources in the pool is indicated by an overlay text on top of 
	the icon. Double clicking the pool or choosing &quot;Members&quot; from the right click context menu will drill down into the pool
	and allow you to see the statuses of the resources within the pool.</p>
