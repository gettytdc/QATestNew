		<p>Release Manager</p>
	</div>

	<p>The Release Manager interface is located directly off the
	welcome screen, and it can be reached at any time within the Blue
	Prism client by choosing <code>Release Manager</code> in the
	<code>Go To</code> list on the left of the client window.</p>
	
	<p>From this interface, you can create, delete and modify packages,
	and create, import and verify releases, as well as view details of
	previously created and imported releases.</p>
	
	<h3 id="tree">Release Manager Tree</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-tree.png" alt="Release Manager Tree"/>
	</div>
	<p>The tree on the left of the Release Manager panel is made up of
	all the packages registered in the current environment, and any
	releases related to those packages, whether they have been created
	within this environment or imported from a different environment.
	</p>
	
	<p>The releases created from this environment are symbolized within
	their icons by a green arrow pointing from the closed parcel to the
	outside of the icon. Release imported into this environment instead
	contain a blue arrow pointing from outside the icon to the box.</p>
	
	<p>On entry to the Release Manager, or if the root entry of the tree
	is selected, the <a href="#package-overview">Package Overview</a> is
	displayed in the detail pane on the right of the client.</p>
	
	<p>When a package is selected in the tree, or a package is
	double-clicked in the package overview, the <a
	href="#package-details">Package Details</a> panel is displayed in
	the detail pane.</p>
	
	<p>When a release is selected in the tree, or a release is
	double-clicked in the package details panel, the <a
	href="#release-details">Release Details</a> panel is displayed in
	the detail pane.</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-package-overview.png"
			alt="Package Overview"/>
	</div>
	<h3 id="package-overview">Package Overview</h3>
	<p>The Package Overview displays a list of the packages with some
	basic details about the packages - their names, dates of creation,
	which user created the package, and the date of the last release
	from the package, whether created or imported.</p>
	<p>A button on the package overview panel initiates the <code>
	New Package</code> wizard to create and configure a new package.</p>
	<p>Double clicking a package in this overview will open the package
	into a package details screen, and selecting a package enables the
	package-specific <a href="tasks">tasks</a>, allowing, for example,
	the package to be modified or deleted.</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-package-details.png"

	</div>
	<h3 id="package-details">Package Details</h3>
	<p>The Package Details panel displays full details about the
	package, including its name, description, creation date and the user
	who created it and a list of the package contents along with a basic
	release log for the package.</p>
	<p>From the package detail screen, buttons are available to initiate
	wizards which can edit the package or create a new release based on
	the package.</p>
	<p>Double clicking a release in the <code>Releases</code> list will
	open the release into the <a href="#release-details">Release
	Details</a> panel, replacing this package details panel.</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-release-details.png"
			alt="Release Details"/>
	</div>
	<h3 id="release-details">Release Details</h3>
	<p>The Release Details panel displays the full details for the
	release - its name, release notes, creation or import date and the
	user who created or imported it, and the contents of the release
	(which may differ from the package if, for example, the package has
	been modified since the release was created or if some of the
	package contents have been deleted or renamed).</p>

	</div>
	<h3 id="tasks">Release Manager Tasks</h3>
	<p>Release Manager tasks can be performed by clicking on the task
	links in the far left of the Blue Prism client.</p>
	
	<p>If no package or release is selected, only those tasks which do
	not perform on a particular package can be performed. By selecting
	a package or release, either in the tree or in the package overview,
	the package-specific tasks become enabled.</p>

	<p>The tasks allow you to initiate wizards for all of the release
	manager functions - namely :-</p>
