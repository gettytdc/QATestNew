    <h3>Choice Stage</h3>

    <p>The choice stage provides an easy way to branch the flow of your process. Example scenarios
    in which this facility may be useful include the case in which different action is required
    depending on the type of bank account in question; or the case in which a different job needs
    to be selected from a queue depending on the business rules in place.</p>

    <h5 class="bold">Properties Form</h5>

    <p>The properties form of the choice stage presents a list into which you may enter your choice
    criteria. Each row in the list may be given a friendly name (such as "Current Account" or
    "Postal Savings Account") and must be given a choice criterion. A criterion must be a yes/no
    decision and as may be entered into a <a href="frmStagePropertiesDecision.htm">Decision
    Stage</a>.</p>

    <p>A choice criterion may be typed in directly; a flag data item may be dragged into the
    criterion field from the <a href="helpDataExplorer.htm">Data Item Explorer</a>; or a
    complicated expression may be constructed using the pop up expression builder, available from
    the button towards the bottom of the form.</p>

    <p>Rows may be reordered using the "move up" and "move down" buttons. The is important because
    when the process is run, it is the first yes/no choice criterion which evaluates to true that
    determines the branch down which the process will flow.</p>

    <h5 class="bold">Branching of the Process</h5>

    <p>The following describes how Blue Prism determines which branch of the process down which to
    flow.</p>

    <p>Each choice criterion is evaluated in turn starting from the top working downwards. As soon
    as one row evaluates to true, the process flows down the corresponding branch, without stopping
    to evaluate any further rows.</p>

    <p>For this reason you should think carefully about which order you enter your choice criteria.
    You may reorder them afterwards using the "move up" and "move down" buttons.</p>
