    <h3>Process Comparison Wizard</h3>

    <p>The process comparison wizard guides you through the task of selecting two valid processes
    for comparison.</p>

    <p>First you must decide whether you want to compare two processes from the database, or
    whether you wish to compare an existing process from the database with another process
    contained in a flat file. Such a process may have been exported at an earlier date.</p>

    <p>Second you must choose the first of the two processes to compare. Regardless of your initial
    choice, this first process must come from the database; only process contained in the database
    will be presented for selection.</p>

    <p>Next you must select the second process for comparison. If you chose to compare with another
    process from the database then you will be presented with an identical list; otherwise you will
    be asked to type in the name of the file containing the process of interest.</p>

    <p>After the final step of the wizard, the process comparison form will pop up.</p>

    <h3>Obtaining meaningful results</h3>
    <p>
		Please note that the processes to be compared should be related in some way. This relation
		may be that the two processes are two previous versions of the process in its development,
		as in the <a href="frmProcessComparison.htm">process history</a> feature. Alternatively the
		relation may be that the second of the two processes is a <span class="emphasis">branch</span>
		of the first, meaning that &quot;save as&quot; was used to produce the second process using
		the first as a template.
	</p>
	<p>
		If no such relationship exists between the processes then the process comparison will not
		show any meaningful changes: all stages in the first process will appear to have been deleted
		and all stages in the second process will appear to have been created.
	</p>
	<p>
		Where the relationship does exist, then Blue Prism can identify the stages in common (ie the
		stages in the second process that also existed in the first) and meaningfully identify all
		other stages as new or deleted (as appropriate).
