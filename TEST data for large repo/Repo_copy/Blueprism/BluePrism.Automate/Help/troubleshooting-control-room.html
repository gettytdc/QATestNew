	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>This page provides some common issues and suggested resolutions
	for using the Control Room feature of Blue Prism</p>

	<h5>My ResourcePC is both online and offline at the same time!</h5>

	<p>When a resource is available in control room, it is illuminated
	with a glowing screen; otherwise its screen is black. By hovering on
	a resource you may read a resource's status. An available resource
	may fall into one of two categories: <code>Available</code> and
	<code>In Use</code>.</p>

	<p>A resource which is <code>In Use</code> is available for use by
	one user only - the same user who is logged on to that resource.
	Thus a user who logs on to one resource using one username and who
	logs on to another resource using another username may see that both
	resources are locally 'online' but that each resource displays the
	other as being offline.</p>

	<p>There are two possible solutions to this problem:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Log on to each resource using the same username.</li>
		<li>Make the resource available as a public resource pc.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>A resource is made publicly available by running Blue Prism from
	the <a href="helpCommandLine.htm">command line</a>. The checkbox in
	<a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a> that reads "When a
	user logs on to Blue Prism, start the process engine on this
	machine" should be unchecked first.</p>

	<p>A resource is made exclusive to a particular user in two ways:-
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Check the box in system manager, described above and log on
			to Blue Prism.</li>
		<li>Run Blue Prism from the command line, under a particular
			username (as opposed to a public resource pc).</li>
	</ul>
