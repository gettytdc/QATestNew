    <h3>Password Rules</h3>

    <p>The password rules panel allows you to manage restrictions on users'
    passwords.</p>

    <p>Passwords may be restricted so that they must contain at least one
    uppercase character, lowercase character, digits, special characters
    and brackets. The full character set for each option is detailed below.

    <table>
    <tr><th>Name</th><th>Full character set</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Uppercase</td><td>ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Lowercase</td><td>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Digits</td><td>0123456789</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Special</td><td>!&quot;$%^&amp;*_+=-:;@'~#,.?/\|`¬</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Brackets</td><td>()&lt;&gt;{}[]</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>In addition to these sets a custom set can be built by adding
    characters to the additional characters text box.</p>

    <p>Passwords can be restricted such that they must exceed a minimum
    length.</p>

    <p>Passwords can be restricted such that when the user changes his
    password it may not match a password used within the configured number
    of previous passwords and/or may not match a previous password used within
    the configured number of previous days.</p>

    <p>Once the password rules have been set click the Apply button to
    apply the changes. The changes will only be put into effect the next
    time a user logs in.</p>

    <p><strong>Note: </strong> It is possible to inhibit the ability to paste
    into password boxes within Blue Prism. This setting affects other
    password fields within the product and, as such, is modified in the more
    general <a href="sysman-settings.html#allowpaste">System / Settings</a>
    section.</p>

    <h3>Log in Options</h3>

    <p>The Log in options panel allows you to select options for the log in
    screen presented to users before they log in.</p>

    <p>A list of users can optionally be displayed on the log in screen. This
    can save time when logging in since users can click their user name
    instead of having to type it in.</p>

    <p>Users can start Blue Prism and be presented with their last logged in
    user name. That is to say, the username with which they last logged into
    Blue Prism will be stored, so that the next time they log in, the same
    username will already be typed in for them. This is particularly useful
    if the computer often has only one user using it. Alternatively the option
    can be selected which uses the windows username at the log in screen. This
    is useful if your Blue Prism username matches your windows username. The
    final option will present users with a blank username. This is the default
    option.</p>

    <p>User accounts can be set to lock out after a number of failed log in
    attempts. Once the user is locked out he will not be able to log back in
    again until the account is unlocked by an Administrator.</p>

    <p>The option to warn the user when their password is about to expire can
    be set and configured to the next day, up to 14 days in advance. When the
    user logs in, a message will be displayed if their password is due to
    expire within the chosen time period.</p>
