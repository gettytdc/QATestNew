	<h3 id="list">Application Attributes</h3>
	<dl class="listplease bulleted">

		<dt id="active">Active</dt>
		<dd>Indicates a window is currently the active window. This
			includes windows, dialogs, frames, etc.
			In addition, this state is used to indicate the currently
			active child of a component such as a list, table, or tree.
			For example, the active child of a list is the child that
			is drawn with a rectangle around it.</dd>

		<dt id="armed">Armed</dt> 
		<dd>Indicates that the element is armed. This is usually used
			on buttons that have been pressed but not yet released,
			and the mouse pointer is still over the button.</dd>

		<dt id="busy">Busy</dt> 
		<dd>Indicates the current element is busy. This is usually used
			on elements such as progress bars, sliders, or scroll bars
			to indicate that they are in a state of transition.</dd>
		
		<dt id="checked">Checked</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is currently checked. This is usually
			used on elements such as toggle buttons, radio buttons, and
			check boxes, which indicate an on/off, yes/no or true/false
			state.</dd>

		<dt id="collapsed">Collapsed</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is collapsed. This is usually
			paired with the <a href="#expandable">expandable</a> and the 
			<a href="#expanded">expanded</a> states and is used on
			elements that provide progressive disclosure such as trees.
		</dd>

		<dt id="editable">Editable</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates the user can change the contents of this element.
			This is usually used primarily for elements that allow the
			user to enter text. Other elements, such as scroll bars and
			sliders, are automatically editable if they are enabled.
		</dd>

		<dt id="enabled">Enabled</dt>
		<dd>Indicates whether this element is enabled. An element that
			is not enabled cannot be manipulated by the user. In a
			graphical display, such an element is usually greyed out.
		</dd>

		<dt id="expandable">Expandable</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element allows progressive disclosure of its
			children. This is usually used with hierarchical elements
			such as trees and is often paired with the <a
			href="#expanded">expanded</a> or <a href="#collapsed">
			collapsed</a> states.</dd>

		<dt id="expanded">Expanded</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is expanded. This is usually paired
			with the <a href="#expandable">expandable</a> and <a
			href="#collapsed">collapsed</a> states and is used on
			elements that provide progressive disclosure such as trees.
		</dd>

		<dt id="focusable">Focusable</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element can accept keyboard focus. Being
			focusable means all events resulting from typing on the
			keyboard will normally be passed to it when it has focus.
			See also: <a href="#focused">focused</a>.</dd>

		<dt id="focused">Focused</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element currently has the keyboard focus. A
			focused element is the element that receives keyboard input.
			See also: <a href="#focusable">focusable</a></dd>

		<dt id="horizontal">Horizontal</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates the orientation of this element is horizontal, as
			opposed to <a href="#vertical">vertical</a>. This is
			relevant for elements such as scrollbars and trackbars which
			can appear in more than one orientation.</dd>

		<dt id="iconified">Iconified</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is minimized and is represented only
			by an icon. This is usually only associated with frames and
			internal frames.</dd>

		<dt id="modal">Modal</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates something must be done with this element before
			the user can interact with an element in a different window.
			This is usually associated only with dialogs.</dd>

		<dt id="multipleline">MultipleLine</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this (text) element can contain multiple lines of
			text. See also <a href="#singleline">SingleLine</a>.</dd>
		
		<dt id="multiselectable">Multiselectable</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element allows more than one of its children
			to be <a href="#selected">selected</a> at the same time.
		</dd>

		<dt id="opaque">Opaque</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element paints every pixel within its
			rectangular region.	A non-opaque component paints only some
			of its pixels, allowing the pixels underneath it to "show
			through". A component that does not fully paint its pixels
			therefore provides a degree of transparency.</dd>

		<dt id="pressed">Pressed</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is currently pressed. This is usually
			associated with buttons and indicates the user has pressed a
			mouse button while the pointer was over the button and has
			not yet released the mouse button.</dd>

		<dt id="resizable">Resizable</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates the size of this element is not fixed.</dd>

		<dt id="selectable">Selectable</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is the child of an element that
			allows its children to be <a href="#selected">selected</a>,
			and that this child is one of those children that can be
			selected, if desired by the user.</dd>

		<dt id="selected">Selected</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is the child of an element which
			allows its children, to be selected, and that this child is
			one of those children that has been selected.</dd>

		<dt id="showing">Showing</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element, the element's parent, the element's
			parent's parent, and so on, are all visible. Note that this
			does not necessarily mean the element is painted on the
			screen; it might be occluded by some other showing element.
		</dd>

		<dt id="singleline">SingleLine</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this (text) element can contain only a single line
			of text. This is in contrast to <a href="#multiline">
			multiline</a> elements.</dd>

		<dt id="transient">Transient</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is transient. In short, this means
			that the element does not play a direct role in the user
			interface, short of assisting some other element(s) in the
			user interface. Transient elements are not usually useful
			for automation purposes, save <a
			href="frmStagePropertiesWait.htm">wait queries</a>.</dd>

		<dt id="vertical">Vertical</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates that the orientation of this element is vertical,
			as opposed to <a href="#horizontal">horizontal</a>. This is
			usually associated with elements such as scrollbars and
			trackbars which can appear in more than one orientation.
		</dd>

		<dt id="visible">Visible</dt> 	
		<dd>Indicates this element is visible. Note: this means that the
			element intends to be visible; however, it may not in fact
			be <a href="#showing">showing</a> on the screen because one
			of its containing elements is not visible.</dd>
