This is a specially created minimal Java (Swing) test application for the
purpose of running tests against, both in the Application Manager unit tests
and within APC and Automate itself. It could also be used for training
purposes.

The main source file is BPJavaTest.java.

The final output is BPJavaTest.jar, and you can build that by simply running
the "c.bat" batch file. You will need a correctly configured JDK to do so of
course.
