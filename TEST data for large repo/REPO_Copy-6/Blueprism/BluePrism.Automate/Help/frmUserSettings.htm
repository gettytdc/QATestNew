    <h3>Editing User Settings</h3>

    <p>The user settings form consists of three sections: the username and password, user expiry
    settings and user permissions. When updating a user's settings it is not necessary to update
    all settings at once - only the changed fields will be updated.</p>

    <h3>Usernames and Passwords</h3>

    <p>When updating the settings of an existing user, the password field will contain eight dots
    to represent the existing password, regardless of the true length of the user's real password.
    Only if changes are made to one of the password fields will the user's password be updated.</p>

    <h3>User Expiry Settings</h3>

    <p>There are two expiry dates found on this settings tab page: the user expiry sets a date
    after which the user account will be made inactive, preventing the user from logging in to
    Blue Prism; the password expiry sets a date on which the user will be forced to change their
    password.</p>

    <h3>User Permissions Settings</h3>

    <p>User permissions determine what actions an individual user may perform within Blue Prism. The
    roles which appear on the left hand side of the user permissions page provide a quick way to
    grant a user a predetermined set of permissions. The use of roles and permissions is described
    in more detail on <a href="frmManageRoles.htm">the Blue Prism Roles help page</a> and
    <a href="helpUserPermissions.htm">the user permissions help page</a>, respectively.</p>
