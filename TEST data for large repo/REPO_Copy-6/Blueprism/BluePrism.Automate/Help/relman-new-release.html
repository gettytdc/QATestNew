	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
	
	<p>The New Release wizard is used to create a release - an output
	file containing all the components defined in a package in their
	current configured state.</p>
	
	<p>When successfully executed, the wizard will generate a file which
	can be imported into another Blue Prism environment, transferring
	all the components and their states to the target.</p>
	
	<p>It can be initiated from the main menu in the client - found
	by selecting <code>File | Export | New Release</code>, or by
	pressing the shortcut keys <code>Ctrl-R</code>. It can also be
	started by clicking on the <code>New Release</code> task within
	<a href="relman-ui.html">Release Manager</a> or pressing the
	<code>New Release</code> button in the relevant <a
	href="relman-ui.html#package-details">Package Details</a> panel.</p>
	
	<h3 id="stages">Stages</h3>
	<p>The stages involved in creating a release are the following:-</p>
	<dl class="listplease">
		<dt><a href="#package">Package</a></dt>
		<dd><p>Choose the package that you want to create a release from -
		either an existing package or an adhoc package just for this
		release.</p>
		<p><strong>Note: </strong> This stage is not shown if you are
		creating a release from a selected package in Release Manager.
		</p></dd>
		
		<dt><a href="#contents">Package Contents</a></dt>
		<dd>Decide the contents of the adhoc package from which the
		release should be drawn. Only shown if an adhoc package was
		chosen in the <a href="#package-stage">Package Stage</a>.
		</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="#name">Name</a></dt>
		<dd>Set the name of the release</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="#notes">Release Notes</a></dt>
		<dd>Set the release notes for the release</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="#file">Output File</a></dt>
		<dd>Set the output file destination for the generated release
		</dd>
		
	</dl>

	</div>
	<h4 id="package">Package</h4>
	<p>The package from which the release should be created is chosen
	in this stage.</p>
	<p>A pre-existing package can be selected, or an adhoc package can
	be created on the fly from which the release is created.</p>
	<p>Note that the release contents is loaded from the database, not
	from what is currently open in the client - if the component in
	question hasn't yet been saved, then the release may not contain the
	latest version.</p>
	<p>This stage is omitted if a package is selected in <a
	href="#relman-ui.html">Release Manager</a> and the wizard is
	initiated from there.</p>

	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newrelease-contents.png"
			alt="Name Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="contents">Adhoc Package Contents</h4>
	<p>The contents of the adhoc package whence to build the release is
	configured here.</p>
	<p>This stage is omitted if the wizard is not set to build a release
	from an adhoc release, either because the wizard was launched from a
	chosen package in <a href="relman-ui.html">Release Manager</a> or
	because a predefined package was selected in the <a href="#package">
	Package</a> stage.</p>


	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newrelease-name.png"
			alt="Name Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="name">Name</h4>
	<p>The name of the release is entered here. The name must be unique
	among releases within the same package.</p>
	<p>The release name is mandatory - ie. it must be at least one
	character, and can contain up to a maximum of 255 characters.</p>

	<hr class="clearer light"/>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newrelease-notes.png"
			alt="Release Notes Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="notes">Release Notes</h4>
	<p>Each release can contain a set of notes with release-specific
	instructions or documentary paragraphs. Such notes are entered on
	this stage.</p>
	<p>The notes are not mandatory and there is no practical limit to
	the amount of text which can be entered.</p>
	<p>The release notes are displayed on the <a
	href="relman-ui.html#release-details">Release Details</a> panel when
	the release is selected.</p>

	<hr class="clearer light"/>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newrelease-file.png"
			alt="Output File Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="file">Output File</h4>
	<p>The file into which the release should be saved can be set
	here. A warning is issued if the chosen filename already exists.</p>
	<p>The output file stage will be prepopulated with a filename based
	on the chosen <a href="#name">release name</a>, saved in the last
	directory specified in a release manager wizard.</p>
	
	<hr class="clearer light"/>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newrelease-working.png"
			alt="Export Release Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="package">Export Release</h4>
	<p>After choosing the file and pressing <code>Next &gt;</code>, the
	wizard will load all the components of the package and export them
	to the selected output file.</p>
	<p>If any errors occur while exporting, they will be displayed and
	the user is given the option to return and alter any of the previous
	stages (eg. choosing a different output file path or a different
	name).</p>
