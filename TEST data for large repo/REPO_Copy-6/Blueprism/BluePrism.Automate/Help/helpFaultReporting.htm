    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>This document gives you some brief tips on how to help Blue Prism when reporting a problem
    with Blue Prism. In most cases, the tip will consist of having to hand some important information
    when you <a href="contact.html">pick up the phone</a>.</p>



    <h3>Ways to assist us</h3>
    <ul>
		<li class="bold">Version Information
			<p class="indented">
				Version information is vital when dealing with problems. We are constantly updating and
				improving our software, meaning that you may not be using the same version of Blue Prism as
				another one of our many customers. By telling us the version of the software that you are
				running, you enable us to accurately simulate the problem that you report by testing against
				the correct version rather than a newer updated version or an older less sophisticated
				version.
			</p>
				
			<p class="indented">
				You may find out which version of Blue Prism you are running by clicking the &quot;About&quot; option
				from the &quot;Help&quot; menu. Here you will find several version numbers for numerous components
				&mdash; please provide us with all of the information available here.
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="bold">Instructions to Reproduce
			<p class="indented">
				To help us to understand and replicate your problem, it is useful to have a clear set of
				instructions that lead to the error of concern. Typically this may consist of &quot;Open Process
				Studio, click here, do this, try that ... etc&quot;. If it is not possible to create such
				instructions (eg if it's a problem that only happens occasionally with no apparent cause) then
				don't worry - we still want to help with your problem!
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="bold">Related Observations
			<p class="indented">
				If there are any observations that you have made that seem to coincide with an error then
				please tell us. Examples may include &quot;The problem only ever seems to occur on a Tuesday&quot; or
				&quot;You can usually tell that it's about to happen because five minutes beforehand
				the whole system starts to slow down&quot;.
			</p>
		</li>
		
		<li class="bold">System Diagnostic Information
			<p class="indented">
				Depending on the nature of the problem, there may well be useful system diagnostic
				information available. For example if your concern is about a process which fails to run
				successfully then it is likely that the <a href="frmLogsViewer.htm">session log</a> will
				contain useful information. It is usually of great benefit to us if you can
				<a href="frmLogExport.htm">export the session log</a> (in part or in whole) and
				<a href="contact.html">send it to us via email</a>.
			</p>
		
			<p class="indented">Other potential sources of information of interest include:</p>
			<ul class="indented">
				<li><a href="frmAuditLogViewer.htm">Audit log data</a>;</li>
				<li>Error messages from the user interface;</li>
				<li><a href="frmProcessExport.htm">Exported processes</a>;</li>
				<li>Screenshots of unexpected visual results.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
