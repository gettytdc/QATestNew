<h3> Skill Management </h3>
<p>This screen lists the latest version of all imported Skills and provides controls to enable and disable them. Skills that are not enabled cannot be used anywhere in the system, including in Processes where they are already used as stages in Objects and Processes. They are also not visible in the Skill toolbar in Object Studio and Process Studio. Skills that are linked to a Web API component that is not enabled are automatically disabled, indicated by a warning icon in the Web API column.</p>

<p>To view any previously installed versions of a Skill, click the link in the 'Previous Versions' column of the appropriate skill.</p>

<p>To view a list of Objects and Processes in which the Skill is used, click the 'Find references' link for the appropriate skill. </p>
