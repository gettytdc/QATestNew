	<h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
    <p>When creating a business object in <a
		href="helpObjectStudio.htm">Object Studio</a>, the first task is
		usually to define your target application. This involves
		providing Blue Prism with information about your target
		application, and building an application definition in the <a
		href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm">Application Modeller</a>.</p>
		<p>Alternatively if the target application has already been defined
		within another <a href="frmStagePropertiesObjectInfo.htm#shared-objects">shareable business object</a>,
		then that model can be used by selecting that object as the parent.</p>
	
	<h3>Accessing the Wizard</h3>
	<p>If the wizard has not been run before, then it will appear the
		first time you attempt to open the Application Modeller. This is
		achieved by pressing the appropriate button on the Object Studio
		toolbar. Alternatively the wizard can be launched again by
		opening the Application Modeller, selecting the root node of the
		application definition <a
		href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#structure">tree structure
		</a> and clicking the appropriate button from the pane opposite
		the tree.</p>
	
	<h3>Completing the Wizard</h3>
	<h4>Choosing an application type</h4>
	<p>The first task is to choose an application type. The names of the
		application types should be self-explanatory and an obvious
		choice should prevent itself. If in doubt then you should choose
		the <code>Windows Application</code> option.</p>

	<p>Note that some application types are subject to <a
		href="licence.html">licensing restrictions</a>. This may
		limit your choice, preventing you from selecting the most
		suitable application type. Please <a href="contact.html">
		contact Blue Prism</a> for advice if you find yourself in this
		situation.</p>
	
	<h4>Supplying further Information</h4>
	<p>A sequence of questions usually follows the selection of an
		application type. The questions that follow usually depend on
		the answer supplied to the previous questions, and on the
		application type in particular. Collectively, this information
		is known as the set of <span class="emphasis">parameters</span>
		detailing the nature of your target application, and its runtime
		environment. Please see the <a
		href="helpApplicationParameters.htm">parameters help</a> for
		information about the individual parameters, and a description
		of the valid range of values.</p>
