    <h3>Resources</h3>

    <p>The resources view shows a list of all resources, or PCs which are available as platforms on
    which to run business processes. Hovering over a resource will display a tool tip of the
    resources current status.</p>

    <p>Right clicking on the resources view allows selection of viewing mode, with Large Icons,
    Small Icons, List and Details views available. The right click menu also allows access to View
    Capabilities. This sub menu lists all of the business objects installed on the resource.</p>

    <p>The drag and drop interface also works with <a href="ctlprocesses.htm">Processes</a> as a
    target. Should you require a process to run on many resources, drag the mouse to create a
    rectangle over all the resources required as targets and then drag the highlighted resources
    over the process which is to be run. On releasing the mouse button, an entry will be created in
    the environment view for each resource / process combination selected. Again, pending entries
    are checked in readiness for starting.</p>
	
	<p> A process will show in state 'warning' if an amount of time has passed and the process is still
    on the same stage. This time period is configurable in the system settings, where it can also be disabled.</p>

	
	<p>The controller of a pool is highlighted by an asterix prefix to the resource's status.</p>
