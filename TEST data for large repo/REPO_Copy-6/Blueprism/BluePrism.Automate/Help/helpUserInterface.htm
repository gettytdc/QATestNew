    <h3>The Blue Prism User Interface</h3>

    <p>The Blue Prism user interface is designed to be both intuitive and easy to use for the first
    time user, as well as providing accessibility and rapid navigation for the experienced
    designer.</p>

    <p>Navigating to the various parts of Blue Prism is done through the single-document interface,
    however when editing and viewing processes, a new window for each process selected by the user
    is created.</p>

    <p>To navigate between open windows (for example, between 2 concurrent
    <a href="frmProcess.htm">Process Studio</a> designs), use the Windows Task bar at the bottom of
    the screen.</p>

    <p>To navigate between menus and other Blue Prism modules, use the Back and Forward buttons at
    the top of the main Blue Prism window. The Home button will return you to the main menu.</p>

    <p>To activate Help at any time, simply press F1, or use the Help menu at the top of each
    window.</p>

    <p>There are generally three typefaces in use within the application, which indicate what
    actions are required to complete the current task.</p>

    <p>The window heading (in the blue area at the top of the window) indicates the primary task of
    the current screen. Within the screen itself, a blue underlined heading indicates an option
    which can be selected and a green arrow button indicates an action, or wizard, that can be
    undertaken. Below each heading italicised text explains the function of each heading.</p>

    <p>The side-bar to the left of the screen provides quick access to all of the key components of
    the Blue Prism system and can be used from any screen to navigate rapidly between modules. For
    convenience, each side-bar box can be folded away using the chevrons at the top of each
    box.</p>
	
	<h3>Troubleshooting</h3>
	
	<p>If you find any of the User Interface has buttons missing, or text that is truncated or misaligned,
	 check your Display zoom options in Control Panel.  Currently the Blue Prism interface works best at 100% zoom.  
	 Other values may cause issues with the display of certain user interface elements.</p>
