    <h3>Recover a Process backup</h3>

    <p>For an overview of Blue Prism's automatic backup facility, visit the
    <a href="helpAutosave.htm">Autosave</a> help page.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Choose version</h3>

        <p>For each process affected by a system failure, you will find the original version and
        the latest backup version. Select a version that you wish to recover. If you are unsure
        then do not worry - this operation is reversible (simply visit the recovery form again and
        choose the other version).</p>

        <h3>2. Restore</h3>

        <p>Click the button labelled "Restore". From this point, the next time you enter process
        studio you will be presented with the chosen version of the process. If you wish to revert
        to the other version then you may revisit this form and restore that version instead.</p>

        <p>Once you have chosen your preferred version you should visit Process Studio and click
        the save button. This will commit you to your chosen version and will clear any existing
        backups. Editing of the process can then continue as normal.</p>
