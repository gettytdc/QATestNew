  <h3>Working with Tiles</h3>
  <p>Dashboards are made up of a series of Tiles, each of which provides a view of specific
  metrics, either in the form of a chart, a graph or other visual representation of a set of
  data. Tiles are created and stored in the Tile Library and can be added to dashboards.</p>

  <p>To work with tiles users will need the appropriate Dashboard permissions (see
  <a href="dashboards-ui.htm#Permissions">Permissions</a> for more information).</p>

  <p>Each tile provides the settings that will be used to build the data source and display
  it visually within the dashboard.  This includes specifying custom parameters to be passed
  to the data source.</p>
  
  <p>Commands for working with the Tiles are to be found in the right-click context menu when
  the mouse is positioned in the Tile Library pane. Additional commands are available from the
  context menu of an existing tile.</p>
  
  <p>The data for a tile is derived from a Stored Procedure created in the
  Blue Prism database. For more information see the section <a href="dataSources.htm">Data Sources</a>.</p>

  <p>To create a new tile, right-click in the Tile Library to show the context menu and choose
  Create Tile. When presented with the Dashboard Tile definition screen the following properties
  can be chosen:</p>
 
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Property name</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>Values</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Name</td>
      <td>The name of the Tile. This will usually reflect a specific metric, e.g. “Number of available robots”</td>
      <td>Free-form text value (up to 50 characters). Names do not need to be unique.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Description</td>
      <td>A text description offering a more detailed explanation of the values represented in the Tile.</td>
      <td>Free-form text value (up to 80 characters).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Display Type</td>
      <td>The type of visual representation of the data.</td>
      <td>Selection. Default is ‘Chart’ type.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Auto-refresh</td>
      <td>The interval to poll the server for changes to the Tile’s data.</td>
      <td>Selection. Default is ‘Never’.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Chart type</td>
      <td>The style-type to be applied to the data source e.g. Bar Chart, Pie Chart, etc.</td>
      <td>Selection. Default for Chart is ‘Bar’</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data source</td>
      <td>A database Stored Procedure designed to return the values for the chosen Display Type control.</td>
      <td>Selection. List populated from published Stored Procedures in the Blue Prism database.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Switch row/columns</td>
      <td>By default the query results are plotted by column (i.e. columns of data are plotted
      on the vertical axis). This option allows this to be switched so that rows of data are
      plotted on the vertical axis instead. See <a href="dataSources.htm#DataFormat">Tile Data Format</a>.</td>
      <td>Checkbox. Default is un-checked</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parameters</td>
      <td>A list of parameters required as inputs to the Data Source stored procedure.</td>
      <td>Data values will vary according to the requirements of the stored procedure. See the stored procedure’s definition for details.</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <p>A <b>Preview</b> tab is also available to display a preview of how the tile will appear
  using the current settings.</p>
  
  <h4 id="CreateGroup">Creating a Tile Group</h4>
 	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/dashboard-tile-library.png"
			alt="Tile library"/>
	</div>
  <p>Tile Groups are a way of organising existing tiles into groups to provide a user-friendly
  storage structure. To create a new Tile Group, right-click in the Tile Library and choose
  Create Group. A new group will need to be named before it can be used.</p>
  
  <p>Once a Tile Group exists then tiles can be dragged and dropped over the Tile Group to add
  the tile to the group. Tiles will be arranged in the order that they were added to the group.</p>
  
  <p>Groups can be nested to whatever level is required, and tiles can be placed at any level
  within the nested groups.</p>
 
  <h4>Rename Group</h4>
  <p>To rename an existing Tile Group choose <b>Rename Group</b> from the Tile Group’s context menu.</p>
  
  <h4>Delete Group</h4>
  <p>To delete an existing Tile Group choose Delete Group from the Tile Group’s context menu.
  Deleting a Tile Group does not delete the tiles within that group, so if a Tile Group is
  deleted any tiles within it will remain in the Tile Library, but will no longer belong to a group.</p>
  
  <h4>Editing a Tile</h4>
  <p>Any existing tile can be edited from within the Tile Library. To edit a tile:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Double-click any selected tile.</li>
    <li>A new screen is shown where the properties of the tile can be specified (see
    <a href="#CreateTile">Creating a Tile</a> for the list of properties)</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Copying a Tile</h4>
  <p>To speed up the tile development process a tile can be copied with its existing settings
  in order to create a new tile. To copy a tile:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>With a tile selected (as the source tile) right-click and choose Copy Tile.</li>
    <li>A new tile is listed in the same <a href="#CreateGroup">Tile Group</a> as the source tile, which
    takes the name of the source tile with the phrase “ – Copy” appended to the name.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Deleting a Tile</h4>
  <p>Tiles can be deleted by selecting the tile, right-clicking and choosing Delete Tile.
  A prompt window will be shown asking for confirmation of the deletion before the tile is removed.</p>
