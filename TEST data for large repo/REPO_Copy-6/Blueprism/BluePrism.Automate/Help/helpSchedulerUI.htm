		<p>Blue Prism Scheduler</p>
	</div>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>The Scheduler configuration is located in a tab within Control
	Room, and it provides a central point for configuring the <a
	href="helpScheduler.htm">Blue Prism Scheduler</a> and its related
	reports and forecasts.</p>
	<p>It will be available only if the current logged in user has
	sufficient user rights to be able to, at least, view schedules.</p>
	<p>It primarily consists of two panes. A tree on the left is used to
	select, create and delete the reports, timetables and schedules, and
	the panel on the right allows viewing and configuration of the
	details of the selected element.</p>

	<h3>Scheduler Tree</h3>
	<p>The tree is divided into 3 groups :-</p>
	<ul class="justthefactslady">
		<li>
			<h4><a href="helpReportsUI.htm">Reports</a></h4>
			<p>Reports provide a mechanism for viewing scheduler
			activity for specified schedules over a given date range.
			Multiple reports can be saved and recalled by selecting them
			in the scheduler tree.</p>
			<p>To create a new report, the 'Reports' node in the tree
			must be right-clicked and "New Report" chosen from the
			subsequently displayed context menu. The ability to save or
			delete a report is available from the context menu when a
			specific report node is right-clicked.</p>
			<p>The <a href="#schedule-diary">diary</a>, displayed when
			the 'Reports' node in the schedule manager tree is selected,
			shows all reports for today and the previous seven days for
			all active schedules. Clicking on an entry will open the
			schedule which the entry represents. Future times / dates
			are greyed out, indicating that there will be no report data
			for those times.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="helpTimetablesUI.htm">Timetables</a></h4>
			<p>Timetables are used to predict which schedules will run
			when according to their current configuration. Again,
			bespoke timetables can be configured to be viewed later by
			selection in the tree.</p>
			<p>To create a new timetable, the 'Timetables' node in the
			tree should be right-clicked and "New Timetable" chosen from
			the context menu. To save or delete a timetable, the options
			are available on the context menu when a specific timetable
			node is right-clicked.</p>
			<p>The <a href="#schedule-diary">diary</a>, displayed when
			the 'Timetables' node in the schedule manager tree is
			selected, shows all scheduled instances of a schedule for
			today and for the next 6 days. Clicking on an entry in the
			diary will open the schedule which the entry represents.
			Weekdays between 9am and 5pm are highlighted, and weekends
			are slightly greyed in order to highlight the 5 day working
			week.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4><a href="helpSchedulesUI.htm">Schedules</a></h4>
			<p>The schedules and their underlying tasks and sessions are
			configured below the Schedules element.</p>
			<p>A new schedule and its initial task are created when Blue
			Prism is installed - this schedule is empty and will never
			run until it is edited and saved to the database.</p>
			<p>A new schedule can be created by right-clicking on the
			'Schedules' node in the tree and selecting "New Schedule".
			Likewise, a new task can be created by right-clicking on the
			relevant schedule and choosing "New Task". A context menu is
			available by right-clicking on the specific schedule and
			task nodes which allows a schedule to be saved or deleted,
			or a task to be deleted.</p>
			<p>Schedules are made up of <a href="helpTasksUI.htm">tasks
			</a> which are also selectable in the tree, but cannot exist
			without a parent schedule.</p>
			<p>The <a href="#schedule-diary">diary</a>, displayed when
			the 'Schedules' node in the schedule manager tree is
			selected, shows a report of all active schedules from the
			previous three days up until the current hour, and a
			timetable of upcoming schedules for the rest of today and
			for the next 3 days in the future. The highlighting of the
			cells indicates the distinction between the report and
			timetable areas of the diary.</p>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<h4>Retired Schedules</h4>
			<p>When you retire a schedule it is de-activated and removed
			from any reports or timetables.</p>
			<p>The schedule data itself is stored in the 'Retired
			Schedules' group, from where it can be restored (by
			right-clicking and choosing 'Unretire') or fully deleted
			(by right-clicking and choosing 'Delete').</p>
			<p>A retired schedule cannot be modified without restoring
			it first, but all fields are readable and navigable from
			this group.</p>
			<p>There is no <a href="#schedule-diary">diary</a> element
			visible when the retired schedules node is selected.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Note that if any data is changed within the scheduler, the
	appropriate element in the tree is prefixed with an asterisk to
	indicate that unsaved data exists for that element.</p>
	
	<h3 id="schedule-diary">Schedule Diary</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-diary.png" alt="Schedule Diary"/>
	</div>
	<p>When a group node is selected, a schedule diary may be displayed
	- the data shown in the diary will vary depending on which node has
	been selected.</p>
	<p>The diary shows a seven day view of schedule instances; reports
	of schedule instances which have run in the past, timetables of
	upcoming schedule instances or a combination of both.</p>
	<p>The dates are shown along the top and times are shown on the
	left.</p>
	<p>When a diary entry is hovered over, the exact time(s) of the
	schedules within that hour are displayed in a tooltip.</p>
	<p>When a diary entry is clicked, the schedule that it refers to is
	opened in the schedule manager.</p>
	<p>The left / right arrows in the top left of the diary can be used
	to go back or forward seven days using the current view.</p>
	<p>The height of the hours can be modified by dragging a dividing
	line up (to reduce the height of the hours) or down (to increase the
	height). Double-clicking on a dividing line will set the height to
	be just large enough to view the largest number of entries within
	the currently displayed dates.</p>
	
	<h3>Apply Changes</h3>
	<p>Immediately below the tree is the 'Apply Changes' button which,
	when clicked, will save all changes made in the Scheduler to the
	database.</p>
	
	<h3>Detail Panel</h3>
	<p>When an element is selected in the tree, the relevant detail
	panel is displayed on the right hand side of the schedule manager.
	This allows the schedules, timetables and reports to be viewed and
	configured.</p>
	<p>See the relevant specific configuration element help for more
	details :-</p>
