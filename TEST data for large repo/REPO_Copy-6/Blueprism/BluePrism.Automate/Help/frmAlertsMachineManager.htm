    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
		Individual machines must register before they may receive
		<a href="helpProcessAlerts.htm">process alerts</a>. This allows Blue Prism to monitor
		the number of seats using this feature, for licensing purposes.
	</p>
	<p>
		This registration takes place automatically when you use the process alerts
		<a href="frmAlertConfig.htm">configuration form</a>; however you may need to
		be aware of it in case you need to manually remove a registered machine.
	</p>
	
    <h3>About this utility</h3>
    <p>
		The alerts machine management tool allows you to remove machines which have
		registered to use <a href="frmAlertConfig.htm">Process Alerts</a>. This is likely
		to be useful when you are no longer using the machine for process alerts. Removing
		that machine allows for another machine to be registered instead (up to the number permitted
		by your <a href="licence.html">Blue Prism License</a>. 
	</p>
	
	<h3>Using the form</h3>
	<p>
		The form can be accessed from <a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Select all machines that you wish to delete; leave all others unselected. Click the delete
		button. The machines will be deleted instantly.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that this may have an adverse effect on users who are currently using process
		alerts on any of the machines in question. You should check that no-one is using process
		alerts on each machine before you proceed.
