    <h3>Clone an existing process, saving it as a new one</h3>

    <p>If you need to change a process but want to keep the original intact, the clone option will
    copy a process, store it under a new name and preserve the original. Follow the steps on-screen
    to clone a process:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Locate a process</h3>

        <p>Open a process in process studio. Click "Save as New Process ..." from the file
        menu.</p>

        <h3>2. Select a name and description for the new process</h3>

        <p>Choose a name and description for the new process, clicking 'next' at the appropriate
        points in the wizard. You will not be allowed to overwrite an existing process by using the
        same process name. When the wizard is complete, the new process will have been created, and
        you will be able to continue to edit that process immediately; edits made after this first
        save will be saved to the new process - not the second one.</p>
