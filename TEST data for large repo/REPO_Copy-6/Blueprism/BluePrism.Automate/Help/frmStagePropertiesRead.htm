	<h3>Read Stage</h3>

    <p>The read stage allows data to be read from your target application and stored into 
    data items in your <a href="helpBusinessObjects.htm#VBO">visual business object</a>.</p>

	
    <h3>Properties Form</h3>

    <p>The read stage properties presents a series of rows, each representing a data
    retrieval. A row consists of an <a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#Elements">
    application element</a>, a <span class="emphasis">read action</span> and a data item. Data is read from the target application element
    at runtime, and stored into the corresponding data item.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		A <span class="emphasis">read action</span> is a description of what data is to be read from the application element.
		For example in a listview, you may wish to read any one of a number of pieces of data, such as the number of rows present, the text
		in the current row, or you may wish to retrieve all of the data at once. Choosing the
		appropriate read action from the combobox allows you to control this behaviour. The data
		item that you associate with a particular row must be suitable for the chosen read action:
		reading all data at once will only be compatible with a <a href="helpCollections.htm">collection</a>,
		whereas reading the number of rows is most suited to a <a href="frmStagePropertiesData.htm">data item</a>
		of type <a href="helpDataTypes.htm">number</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	The data rows are executed one by one in order. If any one read row fails, then the business object halts execution with an error.
	As a result, the parent Blue Prism Process which called the current
	<a href="helpBusinessObjects.htm">Business Object Action</a> will fail.
	</p>

    <p>If the application element in question has been made <a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#dynamic">
    dynamic</a> then parameter values will have to be supplied. These must be set by clicking the
    &quot;Params&quot; button. If the element is not dynamic then this button will be disabled.</p>

    <p>The <a href="helpDataTypes.htm">data type</a> of the data item used in the read
    row must correspond to the data type of the application element. This data type is displayed
    in the penultimate column.</p>

	<h3>Read Action Inputs</h3>
	<p>
		Some read actions may allow inputs which control their behaviour. Such inputs are presented in the list at the bottom
		of the form. The inputs shown depend on which row is currently selected in the upper list, and the lower list is refreshed
		each time the selection in the upper list is changed. Where no inputs are accepted for a particular read action, the lower
		list will be blank and disabled.
	</p>
	<p>
		Most read actions do not require any input, but a small number of read actions do. For example the &quot;Read Text&quot;
		action is used to read text from a screenshot image using font recognition. This feature requires the user to
		specify the font in use, and this font is requested from the user as in input, in the lower list.
