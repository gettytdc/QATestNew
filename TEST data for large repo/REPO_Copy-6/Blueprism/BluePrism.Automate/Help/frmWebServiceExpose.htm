    <h2>Expose a Process or Business Object as a Web Service</h2>
    
<p>This walkthrough provides the steps required to make a Process or Business Object available as a web service.
Once exposed, information is also provided on how to verify that the web service has been published and how to access the WSDL.</p>

<ol>
<li>Enter System Manager and select either the Processes or Business Objects area.</li>
<li>Select either the Process or Business Object Exposure tab and click the Expose link to launch the wizard.</li>
<li>A list of Processes or Business Objects which are not currently exposed as web services is presented.  Select the Process or Business Object that is to be exposed and click Next.</li>
<li>The wizard will use the name of the Process or Business Object to suggest a suitable name that will be used for the web service.
It is possible to change the name at this point, however if the name is a duplicate of a previously exposed Blue Prism Web Service or if any invalid characters are detected a warning will be shown.  Clicking Auto Correct will remove any invalid characters and ensure that the name is unique.</li>
<li>Once the name is acceptable, click Finish.</li>
<li>The newly exposed web service name will now appear in the list alongside the name of the Process or Business Object.</li>
</ol>

<p>The web services that are exposed from Blue Prism can be confirmed by using the following URL which also provides the address of the WSDL.</p>

<pre>http://[machinename]:[port]/ws/</pre>

<p>In this example the machine name is resource001 and the default port of 8181 is in use:</p>

<pre>http://resource001:8181/ws/</pre>

<p>Where the Runtime Resource is configured to apply certificate-based encryption the URL will need to be prefixed with HTTPS:</p>

<pre>https://resource001:8181/ws/</pre>
