    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>This document assumes that you are familiar with the concepts surrounding web services and
    that you are familiar with the relevant terminology such as 'WSDL' and 'URL'. For an overview
    of web services in Blue Prism, see the <a href="helpWebServices.htm">Web Services help
    page</a>.</p>

    <h3>Add a Web Service</h3>

    <p>The 'add a web service' wizard consists of three or four stages, depending on the nature of
    the service being added.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Supply the URL of a WSDL</h3>

        <p>Please input the URL of a WSDL document describing the web service that you would like
        to add.</p>

        <h3>2. Choose a web service</h3>

        <p>If the WSDL document supplied in the last step describes more than one web service then
        you will be asked to choose one of the listed services; if you wish to add all such
        services then you will have to repeat the wizard adding them one by one.</p>

        <p>If the WSDL document only describes one service then this step will be skipped
        automatically.</p>

        <h3>3. Choose which methods you wish to make available</h3>

        <p>A list of methods offered by the web service will be presented. Place a checkmark next
        to each method which you would like to make available in Process Studio under this
        service.</p>

        <h3>4. Choose a name for the service</h3>

        <p>Give a name to your web service. This can be any name and will be the name which appears
        in Process Studio to identify the web service.</p>
