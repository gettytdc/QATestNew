	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>The Blue Prism scheduler runs as part of the 
	<a href="helpBPServer.htm">Blue Prism Server</a> service, but is
	configured on a per-connection basis within the product.
	By default, the scheduler does not run on a new connection. In order
	to utilise it, it must be enabled in the 'System' section of
	System Manager.</p>
	
	<p>Any user with the 'System Manager - Scheduler' preference
	enabled can configure the scheduler for a connection.</p>
	
	<h3 id="activate">Activating the Scheduler</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/scheduler-activate.png" alt="Activating the scheduler"/>
	</div>
	<p>By ticking the 'Activate scheduler for this environment' box, the
	scheduler is enabled.</p>
	
	<p>Note that this setting is only checked when the BP Server service
	is started, so it must be restarted after changing this value to
	enable or disable the scheduler.</p>
	
	<h3>Configuring the Scheduler</h3>
	<p>To enable the other scheduler configuration, the scheduler must
	first be <a href="#activate">made active</a>.</p>
	
	
	<h4>Checking for missed schedules</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/scheduler-missed.png" alt="Checking for missed schedules"/>
	</div>
	<p>When the scheduler initialises, it can check back for recent
	schedules which should have executed while the scheduler was not
	running.</p>
	<p>To configure how far back the scheduler should check, the number
	of minutes to look back can be entered in the 'Execute missed
	schedules from the past <i>n</i> minutes' text box.</p>
	<p>To set the scheduler to not look back at all, a value of 0 (zero)
	should be entered.</p>
	<p>Note that if a schedule is discovered which should have executed
	multiple times in the configured period, it will only be executed
	once. Equally, schedules which have successfully run will not be
	executed again.</p>
	<p>Also note that this setting is only effective when the scheduler
	is starting up, so it will have no effect on a running scheduler.</p>
	
	<h4>Setting the retry period for offline resources</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/scheduler-retry-period.png" alt="Setting the retry period"/>
	</div>
	<p>If a resource is discovered to be offline when the scheduler
	attempts to run a process on it, it will wait and retry the resource
	after a defined number of seconds.</p>
	<p>The number of seconds to wait between retries is configured by
	entering a number into the 'retry after <i>n</i> seconds' text box.
	</p>
	
	<h4>Setting the number of retries for offline resources</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/scheduler-retry-times.png" alt="Setting the number of retry attempts"/>
	</div>
	<p>An offline resource is tested a number of times by the scheduler
	to see if it has become available.</p>
	<p>The number of times to retry the	resource is configurable by
	entering a number into the 'Retry a maximum of <i>n</i> times'
	text box.</p>
	<p>To configure the scheduler to not retry an offline resource at
	all, a value of 0 (zero) should be entered here.</p>
