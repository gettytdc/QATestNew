    <h3>Create a New Process</h3>

    <p>Creating a new automated process using the Create Process wizard is simple and quick. Two
    items of information are required before work can begin in Process Studio - complete each item
    of information on the form as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Enter a process name</h3>

        <p>A name for the new process must be specified. The name can contain any characters,
        including spaces, but can be no more than 128 characters long.</p>

        <h3>2. Enter a process description</h3>

        <p>The description of the business process can be any length, and will be shown on a note
        field at the top of the finished process flowchart. The description can only be up to 1000
        characters long.</p>

        <h3><a href="frmProcess.htm">3.Continue to Process Studio</a></h3>

        <p>Once you have completed steps 1 and 2, clicking Finish will create your new process and
        progress to Process Studio with your new process loaded onto an empty canvas ready to start
        work.</p>
