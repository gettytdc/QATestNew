        For example, if today is Monday and snapshots are scheduled to occur every day, entering a value of 1 will 
		compare the snapshots for today (Monday) and yesterday (Sunday). A value of 2 will compare today's snapshot data with that taken on Saturday, and so on.<br>
		By contrast if snapshots are scheduled to only occur Monday-Friday then entering a value of 1 will 
		compare the snapshots for today (Monday) and the previous Friday. A value of 2 will compare today's snapshot data with that taken on Thursday, and so on.</p></td>
