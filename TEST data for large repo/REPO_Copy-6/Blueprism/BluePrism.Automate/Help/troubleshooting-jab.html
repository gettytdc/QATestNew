	</div>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>This page provides some common issues and suggested resolutions
	for using the Java Access Bridge feature of Blue Prism</p>


	<h5>The target application crashes when highlighting or accessing
		elements</h5>

	<p>If elements spy correctly, but then the target application
	crashes when attempting to highlight or otherwise interact with
	those elements, the problem is likely to be caused by a flaw in the
	Java Access Bridge components, which have problems with large
	numbers (approximately 200 or more) or elements on a single screen.
	You can prevent this crashing by enabling the <a
	href="helpApplicationParameters.htm#Options">'descendtree'</a>
	target application option in Application Modeller. This mode is
	significantly slower, so should only be used when necessary.</p>

	<h5>JAB Versions</h5>
	<p>It is recommended to use the latest possible JAB version for
	the installed JRE. Since JRE7u6, JAB 2.0.3 comes bundled with
	the java installer. Since Jre7u60, JAB 2.0.4 is bundled.

	<table>
	<tr><th>JRE Version</th><th>JAB Version</th></tr>
	<tr><td>Below JRE5</td><td>2.0.1 or 2.0.0</td></tr>
	<tr><td>JRE5 and later</td><td>2.0.2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>JRE6 and later</td><td>2.0.2</td></tr>
	<tr><td>JRE7 and later</td><td>2.0.4</td></tr>
	</table>

	<p>Blueprism can provide <em>BPJabInstaller-1.0.2.exe</em> which
	can install various versions of JAB where the version of the JRE
	does not have JAB bundled with it.</p>

	<p>When JAB is bundled with the java installer it has to be enabled
	this can be done using the following command line. Open a command
	prompt and change to the java bin directory. e.g C:\Program Files\Java\Jre7\bin
	Then run the following command:</p>

	<pre>jabswitch.exe /enable</pre>

	<p>JAB can also be enabled with the Windows Ease of Access control panel
	(which can be activated by pressing Windows + U). The Ease of Access
	control panel has a Java Access Bridge checkbox.<p>
		
	<h5>The spy tool doesn't recognise elements</h5>
	
	<p>If the spy tool does not seem to recognise elements as you hover
	over them, check the following common causes first: a) failing to
	reboot after installing Java Access Bridge, b) using the wrong Java
	Access Bridge version</p>

	<h5 id="TextBoxJRE13">Attempting to write to a text box gives an
		error message</h5>
	
	<p>An error message such as 'Call to setTextContents failed. This
	method is known not to work against version 1.3.x of the Java
	Runtime Environment' indicates that you are trying to write to a
	Java text box in an application running under JRE 1.3.
	Unfortunately, this is impossible due to a missing implementation in
	the Java Access Bridge connectors that correspond to that JRE
	version.</p>
	
	<p>In all cases there is a workaround, though some thought and
	ingenuity may be required on the part of the user. Here is a list of
	suggested workarounds for common problems:
	</p>

	<dl class="bulleted">
		<dt>General workaround - upgrade the Java Runtime Environment
			(JRE)</dt>
		<dd>In most cases your target application should continue to
			function exactly as before following an upgrade, but you
			should consider the associated risk of any potential
			problems before doing so. Blue Prism will function
			reliably against version 1.4.0 or greater.</dd>

		<dt>To work around a writing problem</dt>
		<dd>If you are having a problem writing data to an element, you
			may send keystrokes to the application instead. This
			involves <a href="helpGlossary.htm#Activate">activating the
			window</a> containing the element of interest, <a
			href="helpGlossary.htm#Focus">focusing the element</a> ready
			to receive keyboard input, and using a <a
			href="frmStagePropertiesNavigate.htm">Navigate stage</a> to
			send keystrokes. Such keystrokes may need to include
			backspace or delete in order to clear any existing data in
			the element.
		</dd>
