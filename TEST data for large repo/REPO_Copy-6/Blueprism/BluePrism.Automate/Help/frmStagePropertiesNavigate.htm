    <h3>Navigate Stage</h3>

    <p>The navigate stage allows you to perform navigational steps (or actions) in your target
    application. Examples include clicking buttons, opening menus, dialogs, closing windows,
    sending keystrokes etc.</p>

    <h5 class="bold">Properties Form</h5>

    <p>The navigate properties form presents two lists, one above the other. The first list is a
    list of navigational actions to be performed. These actions will be performed in order, from
    top to bottom. For example the first action may be open "File" menu, the second might be click
    "save". The order here is important, so you should be careful to add the navigational actions
    in the correct order.</p>

    <p>Each navigational action consists of an application element, and an action. The application
    element is the target of the action (eg the menu item to be clicked) and the action describes
    what is to be done to that element (eg click, open, minimise etc).</p>

    <p>The lower list represents a series of inputs for the currently selected navigational action
    in the upper list. For example, if the action is click, it may be necessary to supply
    coordinates for that click action. This list is dynamic and depends on the action selected in
    the current row.</p>

    <h5 class="bold">Adding a new navigational action</h5>

    <p>First click the "Add" button to add a new row. Then drag and drop an application element
    from the <a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm">Application Explorer</a> on the left into the
    appropriate field.</p>

    <p>Depending on the nature of the application element (specifically whether you chose to make
    the application element dynamic when you created it), you may need to supply parameters to the
    application element by clicking the appropriate button. This allows the element to be
    identified when your business object is run as part of a process.</p>

    <p>Next you should choose an action from the drop-down list. This list varies dynamically
    according to the type of application element selected. If an action does not appear in the list
    then it cannot be performed against the chosen application element.</p>

    <p>The last field indicates whether there are any inputs (items to be completed in the lower
    list) for the selected action, and whether they have been supplied.</p>

    <h5 class="bold">Pause After Each Step</h5>
    <p>A pause can be set to occur after each of the navigational actions configured in a navigate
    stage. This can be provided by setting an expression in the <code>Pause After Each Step</code>
    field in the form. If not set, the runtime engine will not pause after the steps it encounters
    in a stage.</p>

    <p>The expression in the field must resolve to either a <code>number</code>, representing the
    number of seconds to pause, or a <code>timespan</code> representing the amount of time to
    pause. If a number is provided, fractional parts are honoured by the runtime engine.
    Negative values are treated as zero - ie. no pause will be effected.</p>
