	</div>

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>The Diagnostic snapshot feature can be useful for troubleshooting problems that arise
	when an expected element doesn't appear in the model that is expected to appear at a
	particular instance in time. Whilst the business object is running if Blue Prism fails
	to find a particular element the Diagnostic snapshot can take full capture the all
	the details of every single ui feature that Blue Prism can identify. This can help build
	a picture of the state of the application when the element couldn't be found.</p>

	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>The diagnostic snapshot feature works for the Browser, Windows, and Java, application
	types. To use diagnostic snapshots you must first turn on the feature for your business
	object. Within the application modeller window select the root node in the application
	model, and press the <code>Diagnostics ...</code> button. After clicking the button a dialog will
	appear allowing you to select one of the available snapshot methods, for Windows and
	Java there is only one option labelled <code>Snapshot</code> for The Browser application type, there
	are the options <code>HTML Snapshot</code> and <code>Source Capture</code>. Make sure at least one checkbox is
	checked and click OK.</p>

	<p>With the feature enabled you can right click any element within the application model 
	which corresponds to a ui feature. Right clicking the element will display a context 
	menu in which there will be there will be a <code>Create Snapshot on Error</code> menu item. Selecting
	the menu item will check or uncheck a checkbox next to the menu item.</p>

	<p>When stepping through an object, if the application manager fails to identify
	any checkboxed elements it will now take a snapshot of the entire model and dump the
	snapshot text into the logs. In the case of the browser application type it will also
	dump a source capture of the HTML if that option was chosen.</p>

	<h3>Output</h3>
	<p>The output of the snapshot can be viewed by opening the business object logs within
	system manager</p>

	<p>The format of the snapshot text uses tab indentation to denote the tree structure
	of the elements, followed by a single line of attribute value pairs.</p>

	<p>The format of the HTML snapshot is chunks of HTML embedded within an XML document.
	The HTML Snapshot text is intended to be sent via email to the Blue Prism development
	team and with an accompanying tool in BPDiagnostics the development team can use this
	capture file to re-create customer web pages for off-site integration testing.</p>

	<h3>Take Now</h3>
	<p>This feature allows you to create snapshot text or source capture text immediately
	based on the current application state. Within the application modeller window select
	the root node in the application model, and press the <code>Diagnostics ...</code> button. After
	clicking the button a dialog will appear allowing you to select one of the available
	take now buttons. Pressing the button initiates a snapshot or source capture of the 
	application in its current state. The snapshot text will be presented in a pop up
	dialog.</p>
