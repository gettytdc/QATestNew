    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Control Room is the area of Blue Prism in which processes that have been designed, tested and
    deployed can be controlled in a real world environment.</p>
    
    <p>The 'environment' within Control Room displays <i>processes</i>, <i>resources</i> and
    <i>sessions</i>.</p>

    <p>A <i>process</i> is defined as a business process previously designed and tested from
    Process Studio. It encapsulates a specific business process by taking pre-developed actions and
    making decisions based on their outcomes.</p>

    <p>A <i>resource</i> is a unit which performs all, or part of a process and can be either
    human, or more commonly, machine.</p>

    <p>A <i>session</i> represents a process which is currently assigned to a resource. It maintains
    a state (<i>eg.</i> <code>Pending</code>, <code>Running</code>, <code>Completed</code>) and can
    be filtered in the view to see relevant data.</p>

    <p>The Control Room shows all of the available resources and processes in the current
    <i>environment</i>.</p>

    <h3>Operations</h3>
    <h4>Creating a session</h4>
    <p>In order to start a new session, drag a process onto the required resource, or drag a
    resource onto the required process.</p>

    <p>TIP: To quickly run one process on several resources, select several resources by
    dragging the mouse and drag the entire selection over a single process.</p>

    <p>Pending sessions appear in the list view in the lower half of the window and are coloured
    orange.</p>

    <h4>Starting a session</h4>
    <p>To start pending sessions, select all desired sessions (using the control key to
    select more than one session) and click the <code>Start Selection</code> link, or right-click
    the selection and choose <code>Start</code>.</p>

    <h4>Stopping a session</h4>
    <p>To ''immediately'' stop a running session, or a set of sessions, select all desired
    sessions (using the control key to select more than one session) and click the <code>Stop
    Selection</code> link, or right-click the selection and choose <code>Immediate Stop</code>.</p>

    <p>To request a ''safe'' stop in a running session or set of sessions, select all desired
    sessions (using the control key to select more than one session), then right-click the selection
    and choose <code>Request Stop</code>. A flag is set on the session that the running process can
    check using the <code>IsStopRequested()</code> environment function, allowing it to exit cleanly
    from its current operations.</p>
