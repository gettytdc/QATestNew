	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>The configuration of the validation in Process and Object Studio
		is managed in the <code>Design Control</code> tab in the Audit
		section of System Manager.</p>
	<p>From here, it is possible to set certain checks to be ignored, or
		to inhibit processes or VBOs which fail specific check
		categories or severities from being published to Control Room or
		saved to the database.</p>
	
	<div class="clearer light"></div>
	<h3 id="basic">Basic Configuration</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/sysman-validate-auto.png"
			alt="Auto-Validation"/></div>
	<h4 id="autovalidation">Auto-validation</h4>
	<p>By default, a process or VBO is automatically validated when it
		is first opened, when it is saved and when it is reset in a
		debug session.</p>
	<p>If it is found that validation is taking too much time, for
		example, while working on a large process / VBO, the
		auto-validation can be disabled here, for any of the 3 points at
		which auto-validation is performed.</p>
	<p>Note that, if auto-validation is disabled when <em>saving</em> a
		process/VBO, it becomes futile to attempt to inhibit saving of
		a process/VBO because validation isn't attempted before allowing
		the save to the database.</p>
	
	<h4 id="category">Category</h4>
	<p>Each validation falls into a particular category - a family of
		validation checks which can be configured together. The
		categories are as follows :-</p>
	<dl class="bulleted">
		<dt>Stage Validation</dt>
		<dd>Checks in this category deal with the stages themselves,
			where the configuration of the individual stage is wrong in
			some way, <i>eg.</i> a <code>Read</code> stage has no
			application element set in it to read from, or a <code>
			Calculation</code> stage is attempting to store a value in
			a stage other than a <code>Data</code> or <code>Collection
			</code> stage.</dd>
		
		<dt>Flow Validation</dt>
		<dd>This category is concerned with the flow of control through
			the stages, the links between stages rather than the stages
			themselves. For example, a <code>Decision</code> stage with
			a <code>Yes</code> link to another stage, but no <code>No
			</code> link would cause an error in this category, as
			would a non-terminating stage with no outgoing link.</dd>
		
		<dt>Documentation Control</dt>
		<dd>This category's check ensure that the documentation of the
			process/VBO is adequate - it may check that parameters
			defined in a stage each have a description, or that a
			stage's preconditions and postconditions are defined.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h4 id="severity">Severity</h4>
	<p>Within each category, there are 3 severities:- </p>
	<dl class="bulleted">
	
		<dt>Error</dt>
		<dd>An issue with the process which means that it will probably
			not run successfully in Control Room or when called by
			another process.</dd>
			
		<dt>Warning</dt>
		<dd>A process problem which may not cause the process to fail,
			but is nevertheless not correct.</dd>
			
		<dt>Advice</dt>
		<dd>A non-optimal part of the process, often documentary, which
			will have little or no direct impact on the running of the
			process but which may make it more difficult to maintain or
			to be understood by other developers.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>The severity of each check can be specified in the <a
	href="#advanced">Advanced configuration</a> for each category.</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/sysman-validate-actions.png"
			alt="Design Control"/></div>
	<h4 id="action">Design Control</h4>
	<p>For each severity of check within each category, a control can
		be set which alters the users' perception of the checks,
		namely:-</p>
	<dl class="bulleted">
		<dt>Ignore</dt>
		<dd>Hides results of this check from the user, so they never see
			the check message if the process/VBO fails the check.</dd>
			
		<dt>Validate</dt>
		<dd>The default for most checks - displays a message in the
			validation window if the process/VBO fails the check, but
			does not impede the process/VBO in any way.</dd>
		
		<dt>Validate and Prevent Publication</dt>
		<dd>Displays a message in the validation window if the process/
			VBO fails the check. It also stops the process from being
			published to Control Room until all checks with this action
			are fixed.</dd>
		
		<dt>Validate and Prevent Save</dt>
		<dd>Displays a message in the validation window if the process/
			VBO fails the check. With this action in place, the user is
			also inhibited from saving the process/VBO until all checks
			associated with this action are fixed.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/sysman-validate-advancedbutton.png"
			alt="Advanced Configuration"/></div>
	<h3 id="advanced">Advanced Configuration</h3>
	<p>Each category has an <code>Advanced</code> button which will open
		up the advanced configuration for that category.</p>
	<p>This allows the user to select the severity for each check within
		the selected category. It also provides a mechanism for
		disabling specific checks.</p>
	
	<hr class="clearer light" />
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/sysman-validate-advanced-enable.png"
			alt="Advanced Configuration"/></div>
	<h4 id="enable">Enable / Disable check</h4>
	<p>The <code>Enabled</code> column indicates whether a check is
		enabled or disabled. To enable / disable a specific check, the
		checkbox should be ticked / unticked respectively.</p>
	<p>Disabled checks will not be displayed to the user, or be counted
		as an error causing saving or publishing to be inhibited.</p>
	<p>The state is saved to the database as soon as the <code>OK</code>
		button is pressed.</p>
		
	<hr class="clearer light" />
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/sysman-validate-advanced-severity.png"
			alt="Advanced Configuration"/></div>
	<h4 id="advanced-severity">Individual Severity</h4>
	<p>The <code>Severity</code> column is used to specify the severity
		of an individual check. So, for example, the check to see if a
		<code>"Stage has a blank name"</code> is, by default, a warning.
		To set it to be an error, <code>Error</code> is chosen from the
		Severity drop down list for that check.</p>
	<p>Again, the individual severities are saved when the <code>OK
		</code> button is pressed.</p>

	<h3 id="import-export">Import / Export</h3>
	<p>Once a Design Control schema is in place, it can be saved to an
		individual file in the filesystem.</p>
	<p>Equally, an individual file can be imported from the filesystem,
		and applied to the current Design Control schema.</p>
	
	<h4 id="export">Exporting</h4>
	<p>The <code>Export</code> link is used to initiate exporting a
		design control schema to a file.</p>
	<p>On clicking the link, a <code>Save As</code> dialog is
		displayed - after choosing the location for the output file,
		entering the desired name of the file and pressing <code>OK
		</code>, the schema is saved to the file.</p>
	
	<h4 id="import">Importing</h4>
	<p>The <code>Import</code> link is used to import a schema from an
		existing file.</p>
	<p>When initiated, an <code>Open File</code> dialog is opened,
		which allows the user to select the file in which the desired
		schema has been exported.</p>
	<p>Once the file is selected, the schema is saved to the database
		and takes immediate effect.</p>
