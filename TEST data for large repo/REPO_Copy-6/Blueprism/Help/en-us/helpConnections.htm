        <h1 class="pagetitle">Database connections</h1>
        <p>The connections dialog allows you to store different database connection configurations. 	All connections require a name, and depending on the connection type other information is required.</p>
		<p class="note">You can view this topic in the <a href="https://bpdocs.blueprism.com/bp-6-7/en-us/helpConnections.htm">online help system</a>.</p>
        <h2>Blue Prism server</h2>
		<p>Connection to a dedicated Blue Prism Server is the most secure connection configuration.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Server name</b> – You must supply the hostname of the machine on which your Blue Prism Server is running. The local machine must be able to resolve the supplied hostname.</li>
            <li><b>Connection mode</b> – This allows you to select the connection mode that is used for connections between the client and the Blue Prism server. Note that this setting must match the corresponding value set in the Blue Prism Server configuration.</li>
            <li><b>Port</b>  – You must supply the port on which your Blue Prism Server is listening.</li>
            <li><b>Callback port</b>  – Specifies a port that the client will listen on for callbacks from the server. This can	be left set to 0 to allow an available port to be chosen automatically. Note that if you
			use this option to force a specific port, only one instance of any Blue Prism application will be able to connect to the server from that machine. This setting is only applicable to Blue Prism Server connection using a .NET Remoting connection mode.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>SQL server (SQL authentication)</h2>
        <p>SQL Authentication uses credentials of an SQL user to access the database.</p>
        <p>Contained databases are supported in Blue Prism but must be created manually using the script generated by the /getdbscript option in AutomateC.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Server name</b> – You must supply the hostname of the machine on which your database server is hosted. The local machine must be able to resolve the supplied hostname.</li>
            <li><b>Database name</b> – The name of your Blue Prism database at it appears on the database server. If no such database exists yet then you may choose a database name here. You may then create a database via the
			Blue Prism user interface.</li>
            <li><b>Database user ID</b> – Supply here the username of the database user that Blue Prism should use when accessing the database.</li>
            <li><b>Database user password</b> – Supply here the password of the user named in the field above. This password will never be revealed by Blue Prism.</li>
            <li><b>Additional SQL connection parameters (non-BP Server only)</b> – Any further semicolon-separated parameters which should be appended to the query string created to access the database. <i>eg.</i><code>Encrypt=true;TrustServerCertificate=true</code>.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>SQL server (Windows authentication)</h2>
        <p>Windows Authentication uses the currently logged on windows user credentials to access the database.	Access must be granted on the database server to allow the Windows user to access the database.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Server name</b> – You must supply the hostname of the machine on which your database server is hosted. The local machine must be able to resolve the supplied hostname.</li>
            <li><b>Database name</b> – The name of your Blue Prism database at it appears on the database server. If no such database exists yet then you may choose a database name here. You may then create a database via the
			Blue Prism user interface.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Availability group</h2>
        <p>The two Availability Group options are the same as the corresponding SQL Server options, but connect to a SQL Server Availability group. The Server Name refers to the Availibity Group Listener, and two extra settings are available:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Port</b> – The port the Availability Group Listener is listening on.</li>
            <li><b>Multi-subnet failover</b> – Allows multi-subnet failover to be enabled on the connection. Refer to Microsoft's documentation on this for more information.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Using multiple connections</h2>
        <p>You may wish to store more than one connection – for example one database for testing and another for live. This dialog allows you to move quickly from one connection to another. New connections are added using the "New Connection" button. The details of the new connection are then filled out on the right hand side.</p>
        <p>To edit an existing connection, simply select it from the list on the left and fill out the details on the right. Whichever connection is selected when the OK button is pressed will be the active connection used by Blue Prism.</p>
        <p>For security purposes, only the password of the current connection is stored, so you will have to retype the password when you switch from one connection to another.</p>
