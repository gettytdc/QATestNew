#						DESCRIPTION
#	This file contains a list of bad Automate expressions which should fail to
#   evaluate. If any one of these validates or evaluates successfully then it is a
#   fault in APC
#
#						FILE FORMAT:
#	Each line represents a bad expression. Lines begining with a hash (#) are ignored
#
#						ASSUMPTIONS:
#	These expressions assume that there exist data items called
#   [SamplePassword], [SampleText], [SampleNumber], etc defined in the process.

# The tests from APCUnitTest were either invalid (obsolete password test) or have
# more appropriate places within the NUnit testing in APC (Operator/Function Tests)
