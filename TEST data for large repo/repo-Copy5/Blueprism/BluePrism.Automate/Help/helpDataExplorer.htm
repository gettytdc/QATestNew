    <h3>Data Explorer Tree</h3>

    <p>Many of the stage properties dialogs have a tree like data explorer panel on the right hand
    side.</p>

    <p>This tree view gives an alphabetically sorted list of all the data items on the current
    process.</p>

    <h3>Group by Sheet</h3>

    <p>To make finding data items easier you can group by sheet, this means that there will be a
    sub branch on the tree with the name of each of the processes sheets and all the data items of
    these sheets will be categorised under these branches.</p>

    <h3>Group by Data Type</h3>

    <p>The data items can also be grouped by data type, this means that there will be a sub branch
    on the tree with the name of each data type.</p>
