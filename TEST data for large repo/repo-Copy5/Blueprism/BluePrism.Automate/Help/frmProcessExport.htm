	<p><strong>Note: </strong> This mechanism has largely been
	superseded by the <a href="relman.html">Release Manager</a>. For
	specific details about exporting a process <em>within a release</em>
	see the help documentation for the <a
	href="relman-new-release.html">New Release</a> wizard.</p>
	<p>The Export Process functionality is still available to allow
	the export of processes and visual business objects to Blue Prism
	environments managed by earlier (pre-4.1) versions of the software.
	</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>
		The process export feature allows you to make a local copy of a process
		(or <a href="helpBusinessObjects.htm#VBO">visual business object</a>) within
		your current <a href="helpConnections.htm">Blue Prism database</a>.
		It will be stored as an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML file</a>
		&mdash; a convenient format for human inspection and email transfer.
    </p>
    <p>
		Reasons for exporting a process/business object include:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>copying it from a test database to a live database (via an export from the test database followed
		by an <a href="frmProcessImport.htm">import</a> into the target database);</li>
		<li>sending it to Blue Prism for <a href="helpFaultReporting.htm">technical support</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	
    <h3>Exporting a Process</h3>
    <p>To export a process (or <a href="helpBusinessObjects.htm#VBO">visual business object</a>), proceed as follows:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>Once Process Studio has started, select &quot;File&quot; from the main drop down menu.</li>
		<li>Select the &quot;Export&quot; function to open the Process Export wizard.</li>
		<li>Choose &quot;Process&quot; or &quot;Business Object&quot;, as appropriate and click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
		<li>Select the item of interest from the list and click &quot;Next&quot;.</li>
		<li>Enter a location for the file to contain your exported process. This may be a new file name,
		or you may wish to overwrite an existing file.</li>
		<li>Click &quot;Finish&quot; to complete the operation. You will be prompted for confirmation if you have chosen
		to overwrite an existing file; this will include the opportunity to choose a different file name instead, should you change your mind.</li>
	</ul>
