	</div>

	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
	
	<p>The New Package wizard is used to create a new package, detailing
	its name, description and contents. The aim of the wizard is not
	to produce a release or an exported file, but to create the
	list of components which should be used in releases / files when
	a release is generated from the package.</p>
	
	<p>It can be initiated using the <code>New Package</code> task in
	the task list displayed within Release Manager or by pressing the
	<code>New Package</code> button in the <a
	href="relman-ui.html#package-overview">Package Overview</a>.</p>
	
	<h3 id="stages">Stages</h3>
	<p>The stages involved in creating a package are the following:-</p>
	<dl class="listplease">
		<dt><a href="#name">Name</a></dt>
		<dd>Set the name of the package</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="#description">Description</a></dt>
		<dd>Set the description of the package</dd>
		
		<dt><a href="#contents">Contents</a></dt>
		<dd>Set the contents of the package</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newpackage-name.png"
			alt="Name Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="name">Name</h4>
	<p>The prospective name of the package is entered here. The name
	must be unique amongst the packages.</p>
	<p>The name of the package is mandatory - ie. it must be at least
	one character, and can contain up to a maximum of 255 characters</p>

	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px;">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newpackage-description.png"
			alt="Description Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="description">Description</h4>
	<p>A description of the package can be entered here - it is purely
	documentary, and is displayed in the <a
	href="relman-ui.html#package-details">Package Details</a> panel when
	the package is selected.<p>
	<p>It is not mandatory and has no practical length restrictions.</p>
	
	<hr class="clearer light" />
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newpackage-contents.png"
			alt="Contents Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="contents">Contents</h4>
	<p>This is where the components which make up the package are
	determined. It is split into two panes - the left pane shows all the
	components in the database and the right pane displays the contents
	of the package.</p>
	<p>Components can be added to the package by locating them in the
	left pane, and dragging them to the right pane.</p>
	<p>Components can be removed from a package by doing the converse -
	<i>ie.</i> by dragging their entries from the right pane back into
	the left pane.</p>
	<p>Multiple components of the same type can be selected in either
	pane and dragged to the other pane.</p>
	<p>Components are removed from the pane that they are dragged from -
	<i>eg.</i> if a process <code>P1</code> is dragged from the
	environment to the package, it is removed from the environment pane
	and added to the package pane.</p>
	<p>If a process is dragged from a group in the environment into the
	package, the group is implicitly added to the package too.</p>
	<p>If a schedule is added to the package, any dependencies are
	determined and added at release creation time - <i>eg.</i> if it
	requires the presence of a specific calendar, that calendar is
	determined and included at release time, not at package creation
	time.</p>

	<div class="captioned-image screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/relman-newpackage-done.png"
			alt="Completion Stage"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="complete">Completion</h4>
	<p>After pressing <code>Next &gt;</code> on the contents stage, the
	wizard creates the package on the database. Once this is done, the
	wizard can be closed.</p>
	<p>If any error occurs, a message is displayed and the user can
	elect to return to a previous stage, change an aspect of the package
	and try again.</p>
