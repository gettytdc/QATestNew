	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
	<p>Environment Locks provide a way for a Blue Prism session to
	'lock' access to a particular resource or a critical section of
	the process, ensuring that any other sessions are made to
	wait for it to release the lock.</p>
	
	<p>Typical uses of locks might be to assert control of the resource
	PC on which the session is running for a short period, or to ensure
	that only one session at a time attempts to update a file on the
	network.</p>
	
	<h3 id="businessobject">Internal Business Object</h3>
	<p>The locking functionality in Blue Prism is implemented within an
	internal business object called "Environment Locking".
	This object has 3 actions, namely :-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Acquire Lock</li>
		<li>Release Lock</li>
		<li>Query Lock</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>See the business object documentation for further details on the
	specifics of the action - this can be viewed by creating an action
	stage, selecting the business object and pressing the information
	icon - a page with all the inputs, outputs and details of the
	actions will be displayed.</p>
	
	<h3 id="particulars">Some details</h3>
	<p>A lock is created automatically when it is acquired, if it does
	not already exist. They can only be deleted by utilising the
	<a href="helpSystemManagerLocking.htm">Locking</a> panel in System
	Manager.</p>
	
	<p>Each lock, when held, is tied to the session which acquired it.
	If the session ends, either normally, or due to an exception, any
	locks that it still holds are released and the managed resource is
	made available to other sessions which are attempting to acquire
	the lock.</p>
	
	<p>If a resource is unable to reach the database when its session
	ends (eg. it has crashed the operating system, or the hard disk has
	failed), the lock will be orphaned - ie. it will remain locked, and
	will not be automatically released.
	<br/>
	Orphaned locks can be released from within System Manager using the
	<a href="helpSystemManagerLocking.htm">Locking</a> panel in the
	Workflow section.</p>
