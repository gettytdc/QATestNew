        <p>UI Automation Navigator Form</p>
    </div>

    <h3 id="intro">Introduction</h3>
    <p>Object Studio provides two primary ways of identifying user
       interface elements to use in visual business objects.</p>

    <p>The spy tool can pick out visual elements to automate, or you
        can use one of the application navigator forms to traverse the
        UI model and identify which element is required in the model.
    </p>

    <p>There are currently two different navigators - one exposes the
        Win32 and Active Accessibility model, and the one that this
        page describes exposes the UI Automation model. Fundamentally,
        they work in exactly the same way, with only minor variations
        specific to the model types that they are exposing.</p>

    <h3 id="opening">Opening the UI Automation Navigator form</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/uia-navigator-menuoption-cropped.png"
            alt="Opening the navigator"/>
    </div>
    <p>The UI Automation navigator form can be opened by launching or
        attaching to the target application in Object Studio, then
        creating an element. When the new element is selected, a split
        button labelled <code>Identify</code> will be shown. If you
        click on the drop down menu part of the button, it will show
        a menu containing:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Spy Element</li>
        <li>Open Application Navigator</li>
        <li>Open UI Automation Navigator</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The navigator form can be opened by selecting the last of those
        options.</p>

    <p>The form will open and load the model into the tree on the left
        hand side. When an element is selected in the tree, it is
        highlighted in the application and its UI Automation attributes
        are displayed in the grid on the right.</p>

    <h3 id="views">Changing the view</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/uia-navigator-raw-view.png"
            alt="The UI Automation Raw View"/>
    </div>
    <p>The UI Automation model allows elements to be categorised into
        specific views, namely, from most general to most specific,
        'Raw', 'Control' and 'Content'. The views can be broadly
        described as follows:</p>
    <dl class="listplease">
        <dt>Raw View</dt>
        <dd>The full tree of automation elements which closely follows
            the native programmatic structure of an application. This
            is the most detailed view available.</dd>

        <dt>Control View</dt>
        <dd>This is a subset of the raw view. It contains elements
            which show information to the user or enable the user to
            perform an action. It can also contain noninteractive UI
            elements which contribute to the logical structure of the
            UI, such as list view headers, toolbars and menus.
            Noninteractive elements used only for layout or decoration,
            such as panels used to lay out controls, do not appear in
            the control view.</dd>

        <dt>Content View</dt>
        <dd>This is a subset of the control view. It contains elements
            which convey information in a user interface, including UI
            elements that can receive keyboard focus and some text
            that is not a label on a UI element.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>More information on UI Automation views is available on the
        <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee671698(v=vs.85).aspx#views">
        MSDN UI Automation Tree Overview</a> page.

    <p>The default view used by the navigator in Blue Prism is 'Control',
        but you can change the current view by selecting the desired
        view in the top left of the form.</p>

    <p>Note that some views alter the hierarchy such that the parent
        of an element in the 'Control' view may differ from the parent
        of the same element in the 'Raw' view. This makes no difference
        to the element stored in the VBO's application model when an
        element is selected - ie. the view will not affect the parent
        data which is stored against a selected element.</p>

    <h3 id="filtering">Filtering the model</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/uia-navigator-filter.png"
            alt="Filtering the UI Automation model"/>
    </div>
    <p>The model can be filtered by entering a search term in the filter
        box above the model. On pressing enter or after stopping typing
        for a short while, the tree will be filtered such that it will
        only contain elements whose names or selected attributes contain
        the filter text.</p>
    <p>The filter text can be cleared by pressing the red 'x' on the
        right of the filter text box.</p>

    <h3 id="hiding" style="clear:left">Hiding or showing the attributes</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/uia-navigator-hide-attributes.png"
            alt="Hiding the attributes"/>
    </div>
    <p>The visibility of the attribute list can be toggled by clicking
        on the button at the middle top of the form. This has no
        functional effect beyond the simplification of the interface.</p>

    <h3 id="selecting" style="clear:left">Selecting an element</h3>
    <p>The element can be added into the application model by pressing
        the <code>OK</code> button after choosing the desired element
        in the tree.</p>
    <p>To cancel a selection, the <code>Cancel</code> button can be
        pressed. This will close the navigator form with no change
        made to the underlying application model.</p>
