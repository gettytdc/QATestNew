    <h3>Processes</h3>

    <p>The processes view shows a list of all available business processes which have been
    <a href="frmStagePropertiesProcessInfo.htm">published to the Control Room</a>, displayed
    in their process groups.</p>

    <p>To apply a process to a resource, highlight the process required and drag it over the
    resource you want to run it on. This will create a pending entry in the
    <a href="ctlenvironment.htm">environment</a> area, which shows all current process /
    <a href="ctlresources.htm">resource</a> combinations, whether they are running, stopped or
    pending. Newly added processes are checked in readiness for starting.</p>

	<p> A process will show in state 'warning' if an amount of time has passed and the process is still
on the same stage. This time period is configurable in the system settings, where it can also be disabled.</p>
