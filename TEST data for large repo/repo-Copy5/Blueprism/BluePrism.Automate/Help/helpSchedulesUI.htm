	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>When a schedule is selected in the schedule manager tree, it is
	displayed in the right-hand pane of the Blue Prism client.</p>
	<p>From here, the schedule can be configured to execute from a
	particular date, repeating at various intervals and expiring on a
	particular date.</p>
	<p>The tasks which form the schedule's execution plan can be
	configured using the <a href="helpTasksUI.htm">Task Configuration
	</a> component.</p>

	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-newschedule.png"
			alt="Creating a schedule"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule is created by right-clicking the 'Schedules' element
	of the schedule manager tree and selecting 'New Schedule'.</p>
	<p>A new schedule populated with default values will be created and
	automatically selected in the right-hand pane. Note that until the
	schedule is saved, it does not exist on the database and will not be
	executed by a running scheduler.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<h3 id="configure-sched">Configuring a schedule</h3>
	<h4 id="run-once">A simple schedule - running once</h4>
	<p>When a new schedule is created, it will have an automatically
	generated name and will initially be set to run once at the current
	date and time.</p>
	<p>To create a schedule which just runs once at a specified date and
	time, the "Starts On" date and "Run At" time should be changed to
	indicate the date and time that the schedule should execute.</p>
	<p>To configure a task, see the <a 
	href="helpTasksUI.htm#configure-task">'Configuring Tasks'</a>
	section.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<h4 id="run-hourly">Running hourly</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-hourly.png"
			alt="Running a schedule hourly"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be executed at hourly intervals which fall in
	between specified times.</p>
	<p>Selecting the "Runs Hourly/Minutely" radio button and the 'Every
	&lt;n&gt; hour(s)' radio button enables the hourly running of the
	schedule.</p>
	<p>It can be configured to run every hour, every 2 hours, etc. up to
	a maximum of 999 hours.</p>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-hourly-calendar.png"
			alt="An hourly schedule on specific working days"/>
	</div>
	<p>By default, the schedule will run each interval it is due to run,
	but this can be further constrained by setting the times between
	which the schedule should be executed. Activation times outside
	those specified will not cause the schedule to execute.</p>
	<p>The schedule can also be configured to run hourly only on working
	days as defined in a predefined calendar, by ticking the 'Only on
	days in the &lt;calendar&gt;' checkbox, and selecting the desired
	calendar from the drop down list.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>

	<h4 id="run-minutely">Running minutely</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-minutely.png"
			alt="Running a schedule minutely"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be executed at minute intervals at times which
	fall in between specified boundaries.</p>
	<p>The configuration of a schedule running at minute intervals is
	identical to that of a schedule running at <a href="#run-hourly">
	hour intervals</a> with the same options available.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>

	<h4 id="run-daily">Running daily</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-daily.png"
			alt="Running a schedule daily"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be executed at daily intervals or on working days
	specified in a predefined <a href="helpCalendar.htm">Calendar</a>.
	</p>
	<p>Selecting the "Runs Daily" radio button enables the daily running
	of the schedule.</p>
	<p>It can be configured to run every day, every 2 days, etc. up to a
	maximum of 999 days.</p>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-daily-calendar.png"
			alt="Only on days in..."/>
	</div>	
	<p>By default, the schedule will run each interval it is due to run,
	but this can be further constrained by checking the 'Only on days in
	the [calendar]' checkbox and setting the calendar to use, indicating
	that the schedule should only be activated on working days specified
	in that calendar.</p>
	<p>See the <a href="helpCalendar.htm">Calendar Help Topic</a> for
	more details on calendars.</p>
	
	<h4 id="run-weekly">Running weekly</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-weekly.png"
			alt="Running a schedule weekly"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be executed at weekly intervals on the same day as
	the start date, or on the first / last working day according to a
	specified calendar.</p>
	<p>Selecting the "Runs Weekly" radio button enables the weekly
	running of the schedule.</p>
	<p>It can be configured to run every week, every 2 weeks, etc. up to
	a maximum of 999 weeks.</p>
	<p>By default, the schedule will run every week on the same day as
	the start date. This can be modified to run on the first or last
	working day of the week as specified in the calendar.</p>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-weekly-nth.png"
			alt="On first/last working day"/>
	</div>	
	<p>By checking the 'On the [nth] working day in the [calendar]'
	radio button, selecting whether the schedule should run on the first
	or last working day, and specifying the calendar, the schedule can
	be configured to run on the first or last working day of the week.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Note: </strong> Internally, the first day of the week is
	considered to be Monday, so if, for example, a calendar is
	configured to work from Sunday to Friday, Monday will be considered
	the first working day and Sunday will be considered the last working
	day of any given week (other holidays aside).</p>
	<p>See the <a href="helpCalendar.htm">Calendar Help Topic</a> for
	more details on calendars.</p>
	
	<h4 id="run-monthly">Running monthly</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-monthly.png"
			alt="Running a schedule monthly"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be executed at monthly intervals on the same date
	as the start date (or the last day of the month or first day of the
	subsequent month if that date doesn't exist - eg. 31st February), or
	on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth or last specified weekday
	of the month (eg. first Thursday, third Thursday, last Friday), or
	on the first or last working day according to a specified calendar.
	</p>
	<p>Selecting the "Runs Monthly" radio button enables the monthly
	running of the schedule.</p>
	<p>It can be configured to run every month, every 2 months, etc. up
	to a maximum of 999 months.
	</p>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-monthly-missing.png"
			alt="if [date] doesn't exist" />
	</div>	
	<p>By default, the schedule will run every month on the same date as
	the start date, skipping any months in which the date doesn't exist.
	</p>
	<p>Instead of skipping, the schedule can be configured to run on the
	last day of the month, or the first day of the following month if
	the configured date doesn't exist for a particular month. This can
	be set by selecting the appropriate value from the adjacent drop
	down.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-monthly-nthweekday.png" alt="on [nth] [weekday]"/>
	</div>	
	<p>Alternatively, the schedule can be configured to run every month
	on a counted occurrence of a weekday within the month, eg. first
	Friday, last Wednesday, etc.</p>
	<p>This is activated by checking the "On the [nth] [weekday] of the
	month" radio button and selecting the following:-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Which occurrence of the day it should run on : First,
		Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth or Last. Note that if the specified
		occurrence doesn't occur in a month, it is skipped for that
		month - eg. if the Fifth Thursday was chosen and a month
		occurred with only four Thursdays in it, the schedule would not
		execute in that month.</li>
		<li>Which weekday it should run on</li>
	</ul>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-monthly-nthworkingday.png"
			alt="on [nth] working day"/>
	</div>	
	<p>Finally, the schedule can be configured to run every month on the
	first or last working day of the month, according to a specified
	<a href="helpCalendar.htm">calendar</a></p>
	<p>This is activated by checking the "On the [nth] working day in
	the [calendar]" radio button, and selecting the following :-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Whether the schedule should run on the first or last day of
		the month according to the calendar.</li>
		<li>Which calendar should be used to determine the working days.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>See the <a href="helpCalendar.htm">Calendar Help Topic</a> for
	more details on calendars.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<h4 id="run-yearly">Running yearly</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-yearly.png"
			alt="Running a schedule yearly"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be executed at yearly intervals on the same date
	as the start date, skipping any years in which that date doesn't
	exist - eg. if configured to run on 29th February starting in a leap
	year, this will skip each year until the next leap year.</p>
	<p>Selecting the "Runs Yearly" radio buttons enables the yearly
	running of the schedule.</p>
	<p>It can be configured to run every year, every 2 years, etc. up to
	a maximum of 999 years.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<h4 id="expire-sched">Setting an expiry date</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-enddate.png"
			alt="Expiring a schedule"/>
	</div>
	<p>By default, when a schedule is configured to execute at regular
	intervals, the timetabling of the schedule will continue forever.
	</p>
	<p>Alternatively an 'expiry' date and time can be specified which
	will cause the schedule to stop being executed on or after the
	specified date/time.</p>
	<p>This is activated by checking the "Expires On" radio button and
	selecting the required date and time.</p>

	<div class="clearer"></div>
	<h4 id="initial-task">Setting the initial task to execute</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-initialtask.png"
			alt="Setting the initial task"/>
	</div>
	<p>When a schedule is first created, a blank task is also created
	and set as the initial task to execute when the schedule is
	activated.</p>
	<p>If an alternative is required, the 'Initial Task' drop down can
	be used to select the task which should be the first one executed.
	</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>

	<h3 id="trigger-sched">Triggering a schedule</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-runnow.png"
			alt="Running the schedule"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be initiated, regardless of its timing data, by
	right-clicking on it and selecting 'Run Now'. This will cause a
	marker to be written to the database which the scheduler will pick
	up the next time it checks for changes.</p>
	<p>The scheduler checks for changes to schedule data every 30
	seconds, so the schedule should execute within no more than 30
	seconds, assuming that a scheduler is running on the same database
	that the Blue Prism client is connected to.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>

	<h3 id="manage-sched">Saving/copying a schedule</h3>
	<p>Schedule data can be saved (overwriting any previous data for the
	schedule) or cloned (creating a new schedule with the same data).
	</p>
	<h4 id="save-sched">Saving a schedule</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-save.png" alt="Saving a schedule"/>
	</div>
	<p>A changed schedule can be saved by right-clicking it in the
	schedule manager tree and selecting 'Save'.</p>
	<p>Alternatively, by clicking on the 'Apply Changes' button, all
	changed schedules, reports and timetables will be saved.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<h4 id="clone-sched">Cloning a schedule</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-clone.png" alt="Cloning a schedule"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be cloned by right-clicking it in the schedule
	manager tree and selecting 'Clone'.</p>
	<p>A schedule is created with the same timing data, tasks and
	sessions as the one clicked on in the tree.</p>
	<p>Note that the newly cloned schedule will not be saved to the
	database until it is explicitly <a href="#save-sched">saved</a>,
	either by right-clicking and saving it, or by clicking 'Apply
	Changes'.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>

	<h3 id="remove-sched">Removing a schedule</h3>
	<p>Schedules can be removed in one of two ways - by retiring or
	deleting them. Retired schedules can be restored, whereas deleted
	schedules are unrecoverable.</p>
	<p>Removed schedules, regardless of the method of removal, will not
	be executed by the scheduler and will not show up in any reports or
	timetables.</p>
	
	<h4 id="retire-sched">Retiring schedules</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-retire.png"
			alt="Retiring a schedule"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule can be 'retired' from active service by right-clicking
	it in the schedule manager tree and selecting 'Retire'. The schedule
	will be moved into the 'Retired Schedules' group of the tree. Once
	retired, a schedule will not be considered for execution by the
	scheduler and it will not show up in any reports or timetables.</p>
	<p>Note that the action of retiring a schedule is executed
	immediately - it does not need to be saved separately.</p>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-retired.png"
			alt="Viewing a retired schedule"/>
	</div>	
	<p>Retired schedules can be selected in the schedule manager tree,
	and their settings can be viewed, but not edited from there.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<h4 id="unretire-sched">Restoring retired schedules</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-unretire.png"
			alt="Unretiring a schedule"/>
	</div>
	<p>A retired schedule can be restored into active service by
	right-clicking it in the schedule manager tree and selecting
	'Unretire'. This action happens immediately and does not need to be
	saved separately.</p>
	<p>Note that as soon as a schedule is restored, it is eligible to be
	activated by a running scheduler.</p>
	
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	<h4 id="delete-sched">Deleting a schedule</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/schedule-delete.png"
			alt="Deleting a schedule"/>
	</div>
	<p>A schedule is deleted by right-clicking it in the schedule
	manager tree and selecting 'Delete'.</p>
	<p><strong>Note: </strong> This fully deletes the schedule if it has
	not been executed by the scheduler. Otherwise, the data remains on
	the database for auditing purposed, but it becomes unable to be
	referenced by the application UI or the scheduler.</p>
