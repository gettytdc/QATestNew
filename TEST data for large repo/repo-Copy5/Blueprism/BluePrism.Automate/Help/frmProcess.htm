    <h3>Process Studio</h3>

    <p>Process Studio plays a key role in the Blue Prism package - it provides the ability to create,
    edit and test processes using a graphical drawing interface with drag and drop process
    components.</p>

    <p>The process area (the main white region) is the area of the screen where processes are
    designed and tested using the <a href="helpFlowcharts.htm">flowchart</a> components in the
    <a href="helpToolbox.htm">toolbox</a>. To draw a process, select a drawing object from the
    toolbox and click the region on the canvas where you want the object to appear. Alternatively,
    drag and drop the object from the toolbox onto the canvas.</p>

    <p>Whilst the <span class="emphasis">mouse pointer</span> is over the canvas, the pointer
    changes to show the object currently selected.  This behaviour can be disabled by using the
    View...Dynamic Cursor menu option at the top of the screen.</p>

    <p>A <span class="emphasis">grid</span> is provided in order to make it easier to align objects
    within the process, and a <span class="emphasis">snap to grid</span> option will align each
    object placed with the nearest gridline.  Both of these options can be enabled or disabled via
    the View menu.</p>

    <p>It is possible to <span class="emphasis">Zoom</span> to varying degrees of precision using
    the View...Zoom menu, and <span class="emphasis">Undo</span> and
    <span class="emphasis">Redo</span> functionality is also implemented, via the Edit menu.</p>

    <p>Once a flowchart has been designed and checked visually, it is a good idea to run through
    the process in debug mode, which will enable the designer to iron out problems in the process
    before it becomes <a href="frmStagePropertiesProcessInfo.htm#Publishing">published</a>
    for use in <a href="frmControlRoom.htm">Control Room</a>.
    </p>

    help page.</a></p>
    
    <h3>Stage logging and warnings</h3>
    <p>During process execution, details of each stage can be recorded in the session log. Apply the required 
        <code>Stage Logging</code> setting in the stage properties screen:</p>
     
    <ul>
        <li><b>Enabled</b> - The stage is always recorded in the session log. This is the default 
            setting for the following stages:
            <ul>
                <li>Decision</li>
                <li>Choice</li>
                <li>Exception</li>
                <li>Note</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Disabled</b> - The stage is never recorded in the session log. This is the default setting 
            for the following stages:
            <ul>
                <li>Recover</li>
                <li>Resume</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Errors only</b> - The stage is only recorded in the session log if an error is 
            encountered. This is the default setting for all other stages.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For action stages where logging is not disabled, the values of any input/output parameters
    can also be recorded by ensuring the <code>Don't log parameters on this stage</code> checkbox is
    <strong>not</strong> checked. (Note that password data items are always masked).</p>
     
    <p>By default, logging is enabled on all new stages created for a Process, and all new
    <a href="helpExceptions.htm">Exception stages</a> created for an Object. The logging option can be
    changed for all (or a selection of) stages via the Edit menu.</p>
    
    <p>Stage logging can also be overridden if necessary at individual Resource level see
    <a href="helpSystemManagerResourceManagement.htm">Resource Management</a>.</p>
    
    <p>For information about viewing the resulting logs see <a href="frmLogsViewer.htm">Session Logs</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>By default, should the time taken to execute a stage within a process exceed the threshold
    configured in <a href="sysman-settings.html#warning">System Settings</a> then the status of the session
    will be changed to <code>Warning</code> and highlighted as such in Control Room. However the
    <code>Warning threshold</code> can be overridden at an individual stage level if required, perhaps
    to accommodate an expected delay during process execution.</p>
    
    <p>Setting the <code>Warning threshold</code> to 0 minutes disables the feature for this stage.</p>
