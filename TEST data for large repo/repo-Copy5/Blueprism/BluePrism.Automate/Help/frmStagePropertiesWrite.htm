	<h3>Write Stage</h3>

    <p>The write stage allows data to be written to your target application from data items.</p>

	
    <h5 class="bold">Properties Form</h5>

    <p>The properties form works analogously to the <a href="frmStagePropertiesRead.htm">reader stage</a>
    properties form, except that the flow of data is in the opposite direction (ie from the business object to the application
    instead of from the application to the business object). For this reason, the features of the form have been reversed:
    the application elements are filled in on the right and the data items are filled in on the left.</p>
    
    <p>Notwithstanding these visual differences, the overriding behaviour is the same. Please visit the
    <a href="frmStagePropertiesRead.htm">reader stage help</a> for details of how to use the form.</p>
