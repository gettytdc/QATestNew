    <h3>Flowcharts</h3>

    <p>Designing a new process using Process Studio is simple and powerful. Using the components
    provided within the toolbox, complex business processes can be automated and process control
    and flow elements easily implemented. Here are some guidelines for flowchart creation:</p>

    <h3>Object Names</h3>

    <p>The name of the object (as specified in properties) always appears on the drawing, with the
    exception of the note object which will display the narrative.</p>

    <h3>Start and End Terminators.</h3>

    <p>Every flowchart must start with a Start block and end with at least one End block. It is
    possible to pass parameters into a process from the control room (such as the number of
    accounts to work) by creating data items in the Process Studio and assigning them to the Start
    object.</p>

    <p>To create a Start or End point, click on the relevant object in the toolbox and then place
    the object on the canvas by clicking with the mouse.</p>

    <p>You must then assign properties to the object - right click on the object with the mouse and
    select Properties from the pop-up menu. Add a name, such as Start, a narrative and select the
    object to be implemented as None.</p>

    <p>To add an input to the process, select the Add button next to the Inputs details box.</p>

    <h3>Links</h3>

    <p>To draw a link, click the Link object in the toolbar and hold down the left mouse button
    whilst over an object and drag to the next object, then release. This will draw a link between
    the two objects involved.</p>

    <p>To reverse a link, right click on the link and select <b>Switch</b>.</p>

    <h3>Anchors</h3>

    <p>An anchor allows links to be attached end-to-end to allow the flowchart to move around other
    actions etc.</p>

    <h3>Data</h3>

    <p>Data items are not linked to the flowchart, but provide a holder in which to place data
    within the process. Once created, these data items can be used as inputs or outputs in actions
    and as part of calculations or decisions.</p>
