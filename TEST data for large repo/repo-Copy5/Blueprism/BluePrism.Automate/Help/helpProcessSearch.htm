    <h3>Process Search</h3>
    <p>
		The Process Search at the top of the Process Studio design window allows the user to easily
		find a stage within the current Process that contains an entered phrase. The search will look
		for the phrase in both the Name and Description of every stage in the Process.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Search tool applies equally to <a href="helpBusinessObjects.htm#VBO">Visual Business
		Objects</a> in <a href="helpObjectStudio.htm">Object Studio</a>.
	</p>



	<h3>Appearance and Behaviour</h3>
    <p>
		The search bar is located in the toolbar towards the top of the screen. It appears as illustrated:
	</p>
    <p><img width="236" height="24" src="helpProcessSearch_files/image001.gif" alt="Search Bar illustration" /></p>

    <p>
		If the entered search phrase is found the stage it is in will be highlighted and selected in
		the flow diagram window. If the phrase is not found then a suitable message will be displayed in the
		status bar. The user may continue to find subsequent occurrences of the search phrase within
		other stages by repeated presses of the enter key.
	</p>


	<a name="AdvancedSearch" id="AdvancedSearch"></a>
    <h3>Advanced Search</h3>
    <p>
		If the user presses the <span class="emphasis">Advanced Search</span> option the Advanced Search window will be
		displayed. The Advanced Search window appears as illustrated:
    </p>
	<p><img width="541" height="456" src="helpProcessSearch_files/image002.gif" alt="Advanced Search illustration" /></p>
    <p>
		As with the Search Bar, if the entered search phrase is found within the name or description
		of a stage, the stage will be highlighted and selected in the process design window. If the
		phrase is not found an error message will be displayed in the status bar. The user may continue
		to find subsequent occurrences of the search phrase within other stages by simply re-pressing
		the enter key or pressing the Find Next button.
	</p>

    <p>The Advanced Search window has the following additional functionality:</p>

	<a name="MatchCase" id="MatchCase"></a>
    <h3>Match Case</h3>
    <p>
		If the Match Case box is checked the search will only find stages containing the same phrase
		with the same upper and lower case characters. For example, if the search phrase entered was
		&quot;tEst&quot;, a stage which only contained the name &quot;test&quot; would not be found,
		due to the mismatch of upper- and lower-case letters. 
    </p>

	<a name="MatchWholeWord" id="MatchWholeWord"></a>
	<h3>Match Whole Word</h3>
    <p>
		If the Match Whole Word box is checked the search will only find stages if they contain a
		whole word that matches the entered search phrase. For example, if the search phrase entered
		was 'test' a stage which only contained the name 'test1' would not be found.
	</p>

    <h3>Search Up</h3>
    <p>
		If the Search Up box is checked this search function will look for the entered search phrase
		upwards from the current stage (or from the last stage if no stage is active) instead of
		downwards.
	</p>

    <h3>Details</h3>
    <p>
		The Details button toggles the display of a treeview and listview boxes as shown in the
		above picture. The treeview will highlight every stage which contained the entered search
		phrase, and the listview will highlight the most recent occurrence of the search phrase to be
		found. To change the appearance of the treeview and listview the user may resize the Advanced
		Search form, adjust the border between the treeview and listview, or rearrange the order of the
		columns in the listview by dragging them to a new position.
    </p>

 	<a name="Regex" id="Regex"></a>
 	<h3>Regular Expressions</h3>
	<p>
		When regular expressions are enabled (via the checkbox), Blue Prism will interpret the text
		entered into the search box as a regular expression. Each matching stage will be highlighted
		in turn, with repeated presses of the enter key.
	</p>
    <p>
		See the <a href="helpWildcardsAndRegex.htm">wildcards and regular expressions</a>
		page for more information.
	</p>
	
 	<a name="ElementSearch" id="ElementSearch"></a>	
	<h3>Element Searches</h3>
	<p>
		Within advanced search a checkbox exists for searching for stages which use an <a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#Elements">application element</a>.
		For example if you wanted to find references to application elements containing the word &quot;button&quot; you can check the Search Element checkbox
		and all stages that use elements containing the word &quot;button&quot; will be found.
	</p>
	<p>
		The familiar options such as <a href="#MatchCase">match case</a> are still available in the same way.
		For example if the above search was performed using the match case option, then it would match the
		element &quot;OK button&quot; but not the element &quot;Cancel Button&quot; (due to the upper-case
		versus lower-case &quot;b&quot; on &quot;button&quot;).
