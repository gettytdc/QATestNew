	</div>
	
	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
	<p><a href="helpQueues.htm">Work Queues</a>
	provide a mechanism for modelling the queueing, locking and
	reporting of work items within a Blue Prism environment.</p>
	
	<p>A queue contains a number of work items, which a session can
	lock and work within a process or business object.</p>
	
	<p>Working the queues is done using the work queues business object.
	It provides actions for retrieving items from the queue, altering
	metadata around the items, reporting on the queue.</op>
	
	<p>When an item is retrieved for work, it is locked and cannot be
	retrieved by another session. It is released when the work is done -
	by deferring the work until a specified time, marking the item as
	complete, or by marking it with an exception.</p>
	
	<p>Full documentation for the work queues business object actions
	can be found by clicking on the information icon : <img
	src="Graphics/icon-info.png" title="Info" /> in the action
	properties dialog within Process Studio</p>
	
	<p>Blue Prism supports any number of work queues - they are created
	and configured within <a href="sysman-queues.html">System Manager
	</a>. The items can be monitored and altered from
	within Control Room, using the panel described in this page.</p>
	
	<p>The Queue Management panel can be reached by opening Control
	Room and selecting the <code>Queue Management</code> tab. From here
	it is possible to pause/resume the queues, monitor the queue items,
	mark them with exceptions and delete them.</p>
	
	<h3 id="queuelist">Queues</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-pause.png"
		 alt="Pausing / Resuming a queue"/>
	</div>
	<p>The top half of the page lists the queues that have been
	configured within this environment. The name of the queue is listed
	along with its status and some statistics regarding the items within
	the queue.</p>
	
	<p>A queue's contents can be viewed by selecting the desired queue
	in the list - only one queue's contents is displayed at one time,
	even if multiple queues are selected.</p>
	
	<h4 id="pausing">Pausing / Resuming the queue</h4>
	<p>A queue can be paused or resumed by right-clicking them in this
	list and selecting <code>Pause Selected Queue(s)</code> or
	<code>Resume Selected Queue(s)</code> respectively.</p>
	
	<p>Pausing the queue has the effect of making the <code>Get Next
	</code> action on the <code>Internal - Work Queues</code> Business
	Object return nothing, as if the queue was empty.</p>
	
	<h3 id="queuecontents">Queue Contents</h3>
	<p>When a queue is selected, its contents are displayed in the list
	on the bottom half of the panel. By default, all the items are
	listed, but they can be filtered using the filter above each column
	in the list.</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-posn.png"
		 alt="Showing a queue item's position"/>
	</div>
	<h4 id="position">Queue Position</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot" style="width:100px">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-showposn.png"
		 alt="Showing a queue item's position"/>
	</div>
	<p>When you first look at a queue's contents, each item's position
	is not visible. The calculation can slow down the loading of the
	queue data, so it is only displayed on request.</p>
	
	<p>To show the position of each item within the queue, the 
	<code>Show Positions in Queue</code> link can be clicked. Items
	which are pending will have their position number updated (where
	'1' represents the next item to be retrieved in the queue). Items
	which have been worked or are currently deferred will have no
	number set in their position column.</p>

	<p>The position column can be rehidden by clicking on the <code>
	Remove Positions Column</code> link which replaces the
	'Show Positions' link when the position column is visible.</p>
	

	<h3 id="filtering">Filtering the contents</h3>
	<p>Each column has a filter combo box above it which can be used
	to filter the items on that particular column.</p>
	
	<h4>Filtering items with a specific state</h4>
	<p>All items within the queue are in one of four states :-</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-state.png"
		 alt="Filtering on the state of the work items"/>
	</div>
	<dl class="bulleted">

		<dt class="icon-pending">Pending/Deferred</dt>
		<dd>Items which are still to be worked have this state. The
		items are selected for working by the <code>Get Next</code>
		action in the order specified by the position of the item.</dd>
		<dd>If an item is deferred, it will not be selected for working
		until the deferral date/time is reached.</dd>
		<dd>These items can be <a href="#mark">marked with an
		exception</a> or a <a href="#defer">deferral date can be set</a>
		on them.</dd>
		
		<dt class="icon-locked">Locked</dt>
		<dd>Items which have been selected for work and are still being
		worked are in this state.</dd>
		<dd>The locked state prevents them from being selected twice
		from the queue by more than one session</dd>
		<dd>Locked items can be <a href="#unlock">unlocked</a> within
		the list.</dd>
		
		<dt class="icon-complete">Completed</dt>
		<dd>Completed work items have been worked successfully to
		completion and they require no further attention.</dd>
		<dd>Completed items can be <a href="#delete">deleted</a> from
		the queue as required.</dd>
		
		<dt class="icon-exception">Exceptioned</dt>
		<dd>Exceptioned items have been selected for working, but have
		not been worked to completion. This may be due to a case being
		unsuitable for work by the process that worked it, or due to
		an error encountered in the session while working the case.</dd>
		<dd>When an item is marked with an exception, it can be retried
		a number of items, if configured so in System Manager. Each
		attempt is represented by a separate line within the contents
		list.</dd>
		<dd>Exceptioned items can be <a href="#delete">deleted</a> or,
		if there are no pending or completed attempts, a new
		<a href="#force-retry">retry of the item</a> can be forced.</dd>
		
	</dl>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-text.png"
		 alt="Filtering on the text content of the work items"/>
	</div>
	<h4>Filtering items using text filters</h4>
	<p>Some of the filters used to filter the queue contents are text
	based.</p>
	<p>A text filter is used by entering the text to search for in the
	filter and pressing enter. Entries are saved in the drop down list
	for easy use later.</p>
	<p>The items are filtered such that only items with the entered
	text somewhere in the relevant column are shown. The search is 
	case-insensitive, such that applying a filter of
	<span class="filter">first</span> to the status column will show
	the items as follows:-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>An item with <span class="filter">first</span> in its status
			will be shown.</li>
		<li>An item with <span class="filter">First</span> in its status
			will be shown</li>
		<li>An item with <span class="filter">First of many</span> will
			be shown</li>
		<li>An item with <span class="filter">JUST THE FIRST</span> will
			be shown.</li>
		<li>An item with <span class="filter">second</span> won't be
			shown.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Text filters are available on the following columns :-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Resource</li>
		<li>Item Key</li>
		<li>Status</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h4>Filtering items using tags</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-tag1.png"
		 alt="Filtering on the existence of a tag on an item"/>
	</div>
	<p>Tags are individual text labels which can be assigned to items.
	They provide a means of grouping items together and can be used to
	filter items in the business object or in the contents list.</p>
	
	<p>The tag filter looks like a text filter at first glance, but does
	not work in quite the same way. Using the tags filter, you can
	search for items which have specific tags, or which do not have
	specific tags, or a combination of both.</p>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-tag2.png"
		 alt="Advanced Filtering on the tags on an item"/>
	</div>
	<dl class="bulleted">
		
		<dt>Searching for items with a tag</dt>
		<dd>
		To search for items with a specific tag, just enter that tag
		(case insensitive) into the filter, optionally prefixing it with
		a "+" symbol. <i>For example,</i><br/>
		<code>wanted tag</code> : will search for any items which have
		been assigned a tag labelled "wanted tag" or a tag "Wanted Tag"
		or any other case variation<br/>
		<code>+wanted tag</code> is treated as an exact synonym - ie.
		the "+" is implied if no symbol is given.			
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Searching for items without a tag</dt>
		<dd>
		To search for items which <em>don't</em> have a specific tag,
		enter that tag into the filter, prefixed with a "-" symbol.
         <i>For example,</i></br>
		<code>-unwanted tag</code> : will search for any items which do
		<em>not</em> have the tag "unwanted tag" assigned to them.</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Searching for items with multiple tags assigned / unassigned</dt>
        <dd>
            A tag filter can include up to nine tag searches, separated by a semi-colon. 
            Each tag is applied to the search - they are all AND terms, not OR terms.
            <i>For example,</i><br />
            <code>Account: Joint; -Balance: Overdrawn; Card: *Visa*</code>
            will include any items which match all the terms:
            <ul>
                <li>Every item must have an 'Account: Joint' tag applied.</li>
                <li>No item can have a 'Balance: Overdrawn' tag applied.</li>
                <li>
                    Every item must have a tag applied which starts with
                    'Card: ' and contains the text 'Visa'.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </dd>

		<dt>Using wildcards</dt>
		<dd>Tag searches support 2 wildcards. An asterisk character can
		be used to search for 'any other characters', and a question
		mark character can be used to search for 'any single character'.
		<i>eg.</i> <code>+Category: Senior*</code> : will return items
		which have a tag beginning "Category: Senior" and exclude any
		items which aren't assigned such a tag. A search for
		<code>Priority ?; -Doc:*</code> will return any items which have
		a tag beginning 'Priority ' followed by a single character, and
		which do not have a tag beginning 'Doc:'.<br/>
		</dd>
		<dd>To search for literal asterisks, they can be escaped by
		entering them in the search twice, <i>eg.</i> a
		search for <code>** Star **</code> will return those items which
		have a tag of '* Star *' recorded on them. There is no mechanism
		for escaping a question mark, though a '?' wildcard character
		will obviously match the required character.</dd>

	<h4>Filter items using dates/time filters</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-datetime.png"
		 alt="Filtering items using dates/times"/>
	</div>
	<p>Custom filters can be applied to any of the date/time columns within the view:</p>
	
	<dl class="bulleted">
        <dt>Specific Day</dt>
        <dd>
            Keywords such as <code>Today</code>, <code>Yesterday</code> or
            <code>Tomorrow</code>. 
        </dd>
        <dd>
            A specific date can be entered either in local format (<code>DD/MM/YYYY</code>
             ? UK), or universal date format (<code>YYYY-MM-DD</code>)
        </dd>

        <dt>Relative Ranges</dt>
        <dd>Relative ranges based on minutes, hours and days, such as <code>Last x minutes</code> 
        or <code>Next x hours</code> or <code>Last x days</code>.</dd>
        <dd>e.g. <code>Last 1 day</code> or <code>Last 5 days</code> or <code>Next 4 hours</code>.</dd>
        <dd>Abbreviations can be used e.g. minute/min; hour/hr/h; day/d 
        <dd>Values can also be plural (e.g. mins).</dd>
        
        
        
        <dt>Specific Ranges</dt>
        <dd>Specific date ranges in local or universal formats such as:
        <ul>
            <li> &gt; 01/05/2014 ? dates on or after 1st May 2014</li>
            <li> &gt; 2014-05-01 ? dates on or after 1st May 2014</li>
            <li> &lt; 01/01/2016 ? dates before 1st January 2016</li>
            <li> &gt; 01/05/2011, &lt; 01/06/2011 ? dates on or after 1st May 2011 and before 1st June 2011</li>
        </ul>
        </dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h4>Filter items using numbers</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-num.png"
		 alt="Filtering items using numbers"/>
	</div>
	<p>The items can be filtered on their attempt number. Filtering by
	number can be done in two ways :-</p>
	<dl class="bulleted">
		<dt>Specific value</dt>
		<dd>The value can be entered into the filter, <i>eg.</i>
		entering the value: <span class="filter">1</span> will filter
		the contents such that only the first attempt of each item
		is displayed</dd>
		<dt>Ranges</dt>
		<dd>Similarly to dates, ranges can be entered in the filter,
		with multiple expressions comma-delimited, <i>eg.</i>
		<span class="filter">&gt; 1</span> will show only the
		subsequent attempts of each item. <span class="filter">&gt;
		1, &lt;=3</span> will show attempts 2 and 3 of each item.</dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h4>Filter items using timespans</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-timespan.png"
		 alt="Filtering items using timespans"/>
	</div>
	<p>An item can be filtered on how much time has been spent working
	it. The work time is recorded in seconds, so any millisecond values
    entered in 	this filter are rounded before filtering takes place.</p>
	<p>Timespan filtering can be done as follows :-</p>
    <dl class="bulleted">
        <dt>Precise value</dt>
        <dd>
            Searches for work item attempts with exactly the specified
            worktime. The value can take the format <span class="filter">
            <i>n</i></span> (seconds), <span class="filter">
            <i>nn:nn</i></span> (minutes and seconds) or <span class="filter">
            <i>nn:nn:nn</i></span> (hours, minutes and seconds) 
            <i>eg.</i> <span class="filter">1</span> or <span class="filter">00:01</span>
            to search for items with a worktime
            of 1 second, or <span class="filter">30:00</span> to search
            for items with a work time of exactly 30 minutes.
            Timespans with a millisecond component can be used, 
            <i>eg.</i> <span class="filter">2.4</span>, 
            <span class="filter">01:50.675</span> but the
            filter value will be rounded appropriately before filtering.
        </dd>

        <dt>Ranges</dt>
        <dd>
            Similarly to dates and numbers, a range of timespans can be
            specified using &gt;, &lt;, &gt;=, &lt;= and separating multiple expressions
            with commas.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            For example, <span class="filter">&gt;= 02:00</span> will find
            all items which have been worked for exactly two minutes or more
            while <span class="filter">&gt; 02:00</span>
            will find any items which have been worked for two minutes and one
            second or more.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            A filter value of <span class="filter">&gt; 0, &lt;= 59:59.0</span> will find
            any items which have been worked for any non-zero length of time
            less than an hour.
        </dd>

        <dd>
            As with precise timespan filter values, if the value has a
            millisecond component the filter value will be rounded appropriately
            before being applied.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            For example, <span class="filter">&gt; 02:00.070</span> will be rounded 
            up to filter on <span class="filter">&gt;= 02:01</span>, and 
            will find any items which have been worked for two minutes and one
            second or more; whilst <span class="filter">&lt; 02:00.070</span> will be rounded
            down to filter on <span class="filter">&lt;= 02:00</span> and
            will find any items which have been worked for exactly two minutes 
            or less.
        </dd>
        <dd>
            Note that the work time is only updated once an item has
            been released, either by deferring, marking complete or marking
            with an exception.
        </dd>
    </dl>

	<h4>Filter Sets</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-save.png"
		 alt="Filtering items using timespans"/>
	</div>
	<p>Commonly used filters can be saved to the database for later use.
	On saving, the current state of all the filters in the view will be
	saved and, on restoring, the filters are set to their saved values,
	and the list is repopulated.</p>
	<p>A filter set is saved by clicking on the disk icon above the
	filters. A prompt is displayed where the name of the filter should
	be entered - when the <code>Save</code> button is pressed, the
	filter is saved to the database and applied to the queue contents.
	</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-restore.png"
		 alt="Filtering items using timespans"/>
	</div>
	<p>To restore a saved filter, it can be selected from the drop down
	list of saved filters above the filters. When selected, the filters
	will be loaded from the database and applied to the view of the
	queue contents.</p>
	<p>A saved filter set can be set as the default filter for a queue -
	if done, the filter set will be loaded and applied whenever the
	queue is selected.</p>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-default.png"
		 alt="Filtering items using timespans"/>
	</div>
	<p>To set a default filter set for the queue, press the <code>Set
	Default</code> button above the filters.</p>
	<p>A message will be displayed indicating success, and when the
	queue is selected subsequently, the selected filter set will be
	automatically applied.</p>
	<p>To remove a default filter set, simply clear the filters using
	the <code>Clear Filters</code> link and set the default filter set
	again without any filter set selected.</p>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-filter-delete.png"
		 alt="Filtering items using timespans"/>
	</div>
	<p>Filter sets can be deleted by first selecting them and then
	pressing the <code>Delete Filter Set</code> button above the
	filters.</p>
	<p>After confirmation, the filter set is deleted, though it is
	still applied to the queue contents list - pressing the <code>
	Clear Queues</code> link will reset the filter on the list.</p>

	<h3 id="modifying">Managing the work items</h3>
	<p>This panel allows a certain amount of modification of the work
	items themselves. The following functions are supported :-</p>
	
	<h4 id="unlock">Unlocking work items</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-unlock.png"
		 alt="Unlocking items"/>
	</div>
	<p>When a work item is selected for work within a process, it is
	locked to ensure that it is not selected more than once. If a
	process fails while working an item, the lock may remain on the
	item after it should have been released.</p>
	<p>Equally a session may maintain a lock on an item longer than it
	is supposed to.</p>
	<p>If this occurs, the lock can be released in Control Room by
	selecting the item(s), right-clicking and choosing <code>Unlock
	Selected Case(s)</code> from the context menu.</p>
	<p>The lock(s) will be removed immediately and the item will be
	available for selection from the queue within running processes.</p>

		 alt="Entering an exception message for the item"/>
	</div>
	<p>Work items can be completed in one of two ways - they can be
	marked as complete within a session, or they can be marked with an
	exception. The latter can be done within a session or from Control
	Room.</p>
	<p>To mark items with an exception, select them in the contents
	list, right click and select <code>Mark Selected Case(s) with
	Exception</code>.</p>
	<p>A dialog will be shown where the exception reason can be entered.
	When <code>OK</code> is clicked, the items will be marked with an
	exception immediately, rendering them unavailable within the queue.
	</p>
	<p>Note that no retry will be created when an item is marked with
	an exception from within Control Room, regardless of how many
	retries are allowed for that queue.</p>
	<p>Also note that only pending or deferred items can be marked this
	way, not items which have already been worked or are locked.</p>

		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-delete.png"
		 alt="Deleting worked items"/>
	</div>
	<p>When an item has been worked it is available for deletion. This
	can be achieved using the <code>Delete Processed Items</code> action
	within the queues business object, or by selecting the items in the
	contents list, right-clicking and choosing <code>Delete Worked
	Case(s) from Selection</code> from the context menu.</p>
	<p>When the menu item is clicked, any selected items which are fully
	worked (ie. are marked as complete or marked with an exception and
	have no retry pending) are deleted from the database.</p>
	<p>Any items which are not fully worked, as defined above, will
	remain in the list unaltered.</p>
	<p>If a selected entry which is marked with an exception is left
	in the list after a delete has been initiated, it is likely that the
	item represented by the entry has a retry pending. This retry must
	be found and marked with an exception before the item can be
	deleted.</p>
	
	
	<h4 id="force-retry">Force an exceptioned item to retry</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">

	</div>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-retry-err.png"
		 alt="Error message from forcing a retry"/>
	</div>
	<p>A queue can be configured to support multiple retries, such that
	when an item is marked with an exception, the item is requeued with
	an incremented attempt number. Each retry is represented by a
	different line within the queue contents list.</p>
	<p>If the item is marked with an exception such that the maximum
	number of retries is hit, no more retries can be generated from
	within the process.</p>
	<p>This maximum can be overridden in Control Room by selecting the
	items to retry, right-clicking and selecting <code>Force Retry
	</code> from the context menu.</p>
	<p>When the menu item is clicked, a retry instance for each of the
	selected items is created and entered into the queue.</p>
	<p>If <em>any</em> of the selected items could not be retried, the
	operation will abort, leaving none of the items with a retry
	instance, even if the operation would have worked for them.</p>
	<p>If the operation fails, a comprehensive error message will be
	shown indicating why the operation didn't work - this is typically
	because the selected items already have pending instances or have
	been marked as complete.</p>
	
	
	<h4 id="defer">Set a deferral date</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">

	</div>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-defer-time.png"
		 alt="Setting the date/time to defer to"/>
	</div>
	<p>When an item is deferred, it is temporarily made unavailable to
	be selected for working within a process. It is made available once
	the deferral date has been reached.</p>
	<p>An item can be deferred by using the <code>Defer</code> action
	in the queues business object, or by selecting it in the queue
	contents list, right-clicking and selecting <code>Change Deferral
	Date</code> from the context menu.</p>
	<p>A dialog will be displayed in which the date and time that the
	item should be deferred to can be entered. The date can be selected
	by dropping down the date chooser and selecting the date to defer
	until. The time can be selected by dragging the hands of the clock
	to the correct place or entering the time manually in the text box
	below the clock.</p>
	<p>On pressing OK, the item is set to defer until the specified time
	immediately and it will become unavailable to running processes
	until that time is reached.</p>
	
	<h4 id="status">Edit status</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">

		 alt="Editing the status"/>
	</div>
	<div class="captioned-image screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-status-edit.png"
		 alt="Status dialog"/>
	</div>
	<p>An item has a status associated with it. This can be edited
	using the <code>Update Status</code> action in the queues business
	object or by selecting it in the queue contents list,
	right-clicking and selecting <code>Edit Status</code> from the
	context menu.</p>
	<p>A dialog will be displayed with the current status selected, 
	ready to accept the new status. Once a new status is entered, all
	selected items will have their status set to the new value.</p>
	
	<h4 id="attempts">View all attempts of an item</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-allattempts.png"
		 alt="View all attempts"/>
	</div>
	<p>Each retry of an item is represented by an entry in the queue
	contents list. To see the state of all attempts of an item, the
	item can be right-clicked and <code>View all attempts of this item
	</code> selected from the context menu.</p>
	<p>On selecting the menu item, a window will be opened showing the
	table of retries for the selected item.</p>
	
	<h4 id="copy">Copying the item key</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-copykey.png"
		 alt="Copying the item key"/>
	</div>
	<p>The key can be copied from the item into the clipboard. This
	is achieved by right-clicking the required item and selecting
	<code>Copy Item Key to clipboard</code>. The key will be copied to
	the clipboard immediately and a tooltip message will display
	indicating that that has occurred.</p>
	
	<h4 id="export">Exporting the queue contents</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">

		 alt="Exporting the queue contents"/>
	</div>
	<p>The queue contents data can be exported to a file by
	right-clicking an item and selecting <code>Export current view as
	report...</code>.</p>
	<p>On choosing the menu item, the <code>Export Work Queue
	Report</code> wizard displays, letting you choose to :-</p>

	</div>
	<p>Pressing the <code>Next &gt;</code> button progresses to the
	next stage of the wizard.</p>
	
	<p>Once the data to export has been selected, the location of the
	output file is entered. This can be entered manually or selected
	by clicking on the <code>Browse...</code> button. The output is in
	the form of a <acronym title="Comma Separated Variable">CSV</acronym>
	file.</p>
	<p>Once the output file is chosen, and the <code>Finish</code>
	button is pressed, the output file is generated.</p>
	
	<h4 id="log">Viewing the log</h4>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/queue-ctlroom-viewlog.png"
		 alt="Viewing the log which worked a work item"/>
	</div>
	<p>When a work item is added to the queue, the session which added
	it is recorded alongside it. From here on, any one of a number of
	actions which a session performs on a work item will result in that
	session being associated with the item.</p>
	<p>The actions which cause a session to be associated with an item
	are :-</p>
	<ul style="clear:left">
		<li>Adding an item to the queue</li>
		<li>Selecting an item to work - ie. retrieving it using the
			<code>Get Next</code> action on the business object</li>
		<li>Deferring an item</li>
		<li>Completing an item</li>
		<li>Marking an item with an exception</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The log for the session which is currently associated with a
	work item is available for viewing directly from the item itself.
	</p>
	<p>The log can be viewed by selecting it in the queue contents list,
	right-clicking and choosing <code>View Log</code> from the context
	menu.</p>
	<p>Once the menu item is selected, the log for the session will
	display in a new window. It will attempt to find the area in the
	log file at which the item was marked as worked - this is
	approximate and handled by comparing the time at which the item was
	marked as worked and the time of the log entries.</p>
