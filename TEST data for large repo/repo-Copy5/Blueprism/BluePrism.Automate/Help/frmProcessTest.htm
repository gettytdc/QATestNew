    <h3>Test a Process</h3>

    <p>The testing feature allows users to visit process studio for testing purposes, without the
    freedom to make changes to a process. Users will be able to navigate round a process and debug
    the process, but will not be able to make changes.</p>

    <h3>Locate a process</h3>

    <p>A list of existing processes from the database is presented with name, version and
    description details listed. The information in the box can be sorted according to each column
    by clicking the appropriate heading. To select a process to test, simply highlight the entry
    required using the mouse and click the 'next' button.</p>

    <h3>Continue to Process Studio</h3>

    <p>Once you have completed step 1 clicking OK will open the selected process and progress to
    <a href="frmProcess.htm">Process Studio</a> with your process loaded onto the canvas ready to
    start testing.</p>
