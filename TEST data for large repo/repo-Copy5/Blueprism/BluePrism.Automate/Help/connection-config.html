		<p>Connection Configuration</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>The Connection Configuration form, reachable from the login page,
		provides the interface with which multiple connections can be
		configured to Blue Prism databases and servers.</p>

	<p>The software can connect to SQL Servers 2005 and above, using
		SQL Server or Windows authentication. Alternatively, the
		software can connect via a Blue Prism Server running on a
		server in the available network.<p>

	<p>The connections are configured, by default, per-machine -
		<i>ie.</i> the list of connections is available to all users on
		the current machine and any change by any user will be visible
		to the next user to use Blue Prism on the same machine.
		This can be changed to make the connections list per-user by
		starting Blue Prism with the <a 
		href="helpCommandLine.htm#Useropts">/useropts</a> switch.</p>

	<h3>Configuring an existing connection</h3>
	<p>A connection can be configured by selecting it in the list on the
		left of the form, and then editing the details in the fields
		shown on the right.</p>

	<h4>Connection Name</h4>
	<p>This name is used to describe the connection within the product -
		either on the login screen or in the BP Server configuration to
		indicate the connection that Blue Prism should use.</p>

	<h4>Connection Type</h4>
	<p>Several connection (and authentication) types are supported
		within Blue Prism :-<p>
	<dl class="listplease">
		<dt>SQL Server (SQL Authentication)</dt>
		<dd>Direct connection to a SQL Server instance, authenticated
			using a SQL Login - ie. a user name and password set up on
			the database.</dd>

		<dt>SQL Server (Windows Authentication)</dt>
		<dd>Direct connection to a SQL Server instance, authenticated
			through a Windows user account.</dd>

		<dt>Blue Prism Server</dt>
		<dd>Connection to an existing Blue Prism Server - the server
			maintains the connections to the database itself.</dd>

		<dt>Availability Group (SQL Authentication)</dt>
		<dd>Direct connection to a SQL Server Availability Group, authenticated
			using a SQL Login - ie. a user name and password set up on
			the database.</dd>

		<dt>Availability Group (Windows Authentication)</dt>
		<dd>Direct connection to a SQL Server Availability Group, authenticated
			through a Windows user account.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>See the <a href="helpBPServer.htm">Blue Prism Server</a> help
		topic for more detailed discussion of the differences between
		the connection types.</p>
		
	<h4>Database Server (SQL Server only)</h4>
	<p>The database instance which Blue Prism should connect to - 
		<i>eg.</i> <code>localhost\SQLExpress</code> will connect to
		the instance named <code>SQLExpress</code> running on the local
		machine.</p>

	<h4>Database Name (SQL Server only)</h4>
	<p>The name of the database on the specified instance in which Blue
		Prism stores its data.</p>

	<h4>User ID (SQL Server - SQL Authentication only)</h4>
	<p>The ID of the SQL User that Blue Prism should use to authenticate
		to SQL Server</p>

	<h4>Password (SQL Server - SQL Authentication only)</h4>
	<p>The password that Blue Prism should use to authenticate to SQL
		Server.</p>

	<h4>Additional SQL Connection Parameters (non-BP Server only)</h4>
	<p>Any further semicolon-separated parameters which should be appended
		to the query string created to access the database. <i>eg.</i>
		<code>Encrypt=true;TrustServerCertificate=true</code>.</p>


<h4>Multi Subnet Failover</h4>
	<p>Allows multi subnet failover to be enabled on the connection. Refer
	to Microsoft's documentation on this for more information.</p>
	<h4>Blue Prism Server (BP Server only)</h4>
	<p>The network address of the Blue Prism server that the client
		should connect to.</p>
    	
	<h4>Connection Mode (BP Server only)</h4>
    <p>The following connection modes can be used for
        connections between a Blue Prism client and the Blue Prism server. Note that
        this setting must match the <a href="helpBPServer.htm#connection-mode">corresponding value</a>
		set in the Blue Prism Server configuration.

    <h4>Server Port (BP Server only)</h4>
    <p>
        The port on which the specified Blue Prism Server is listening
        for connections.
    </p>
 	
    <h4>Callback Port (BP Server with .NET Remoting only)</h4>
    <p>
        When connecting to a Blue Prism Server with a .NET Remoting connection
        mode, the client allows it to 'call back' to it - enabling two way
        communication to occur means that some server operations can give
        more timely feedback on progress. Leaving this value at the default
        (zero) means that an arbitrary callback port will be assigned when
        the connection to the server is made. If a specific port must be used
        (in order to open the port on the firewall, for instance), it should be
        set here.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that if a specific port is configured, only one instance of
        Blue Prism on this machine can use this connection at any one
        time - any further attempts to connect to the server from the
        current machine will fail due to the specified callback port
        being in use.
    </p>

	<h4>Test Connection</h4>
	<p>The connection currently being displayed in the right hand
		<code>Current Connection</code> details pane can be tested by
		clicking on the <code>Test Connection</code> button.</p>

	<p>An attempt will be made to connect to the configured Blue Prism
		database, and a message box will display containing the results
		of that attempt.</p>

	<h3>Creating a new connection</h3>
	<p>A new connection can be created by clicking on the <code>New
		Connection</code> button in the lower left of the form.<p>
	<p>An arbitrarily named connection will be created with blank
		details and displayed in the details pane.</p>

	<h3>Deleting a connection</h3>
	<p>A connection can be deleted by selecting it in the selection pane
		and pressing the <code>Delete Connection</code> button.</p>
	<p><strong>Note: </strong> There is no confirmation prompt for this
		action.</p>

	<h3>Saving changes</h3>
	<p>When the connections have been configured correctly, they can be
		saved by pressing the <code>OK</code> button.</p>
	<p>This will save the connection configuration for all users on this
		machine (unless Blue Prism was started with the
		<a href="helpCommandLine.htm#Useropts">/useropts</a> command
		line switch) and it will set the currently selected connection
		as the current connection in the Blue Prism client.</p>

	<h3>Discarding changes</h3>
	<p>If any mistakes are made, changes can be discarded by pressing
		the <code>Cancel</code> button - the form is closed without
		saving any changes.</p>
	
	<h3>User Account Control on Windows Vista / Windows 7</h3>
	<p>Note that when saving the connection configuration on Windows
		Vista and beyond, elevation of privileges may be required. See
		the <a href="uac.html">User Account Control</a> help page for
		more information.</p>
