    <h3>Internal Business Objects - an Overview</h3>

    <p>Internal business objects are a specialised type of <a href="helpBusinessObjects.htm">business object</a>.
    Internal business objects are built into Blue Prism and have access to the inner workings of the process engine.
    As such, they form an integral part of the system, and help to make Blue Prism feature-rich. For example an
    Internal Business Object could provide access to a list of running processes within control room, or it could provide 
    access to details such as the currently logged in Blue Prism user. Such information could not be provided by an ordinary
    business object, because such objects do not have access to Blue Prism's inner workings.</p>
    <p>Currently the only available Internal Business Object is the Blue Prism - Collections Object. This object 
    provides actions for manipulating <a href="helpCollections.htm">collections</a>.</p>
    
    <h3>Using Internal Business Objects</h3>
    <p>Internal business objects are accessed in the same way as any other type of business object; indeed there is no
    easy way to determine which business objects are internal, and which are not. You may use them
    simply by placing an <a href="frmStageProperties.htm">Action stage</a> on your diagram, and choosing the desired 
    combination of business object and action.</p>
    <p>Internal business objects do not require installation; they come as part of the system. Internal business objects
    cannot be uninstalled.</p>
