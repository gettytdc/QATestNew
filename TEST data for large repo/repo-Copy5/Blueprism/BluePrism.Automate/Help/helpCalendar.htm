	</div>
	
	<h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>Calendars within Blue Prism represent the concept of the working
	day. They exist to allow schedules, configured in Control Room, and
	processes, using the internal Calendars business object, to check if
	a particular day is a working day according to the rules configured
	in the calendar.</p>

	<p>In order to facilitate this, calendars can be created and
	configured to specify which days are considered working days and
	which are not.</p>

	<p>A calendar brings together 3 main concepts : </p>

	<dl class="listplease">
		<dt>Working Week</dt>
		<dd>The days of the week which are considered working days for
			the calendar</dd>
		
		<dt>Public Holidays</dt>
		<dd>The public holidays, considered non-working days, which
			apply to the calendar.</dd>
		
		<dt>Other Holidays</dt>
		<dd>Other holidays which are to be considered non-working days
			in the calendar.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Thus a calendar's working days consist of any dates where :-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The day of the week is specified in the 'Working Week'
			<em>and</em></li>
		<li>The date is not a public holiday specified in the 'Public
			Holidays' <em>and</em></li>
		<li>The date is not a holiday specified in the 'Other Holidays'.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>If any of these tests fail for a given date, then the date is not
	considered a working day according to the calendar.</p>
	
	<h3>Default Calendar</h3>
	<p>When Blue Prism is first installed, a calendar is created called
	"Working Week / No Holidays" which has a "Working Week" of Monday to
	Friday (inclusive), and specifies no holidays, public or otherwise.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Creating a calendar</h3>
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/calendar-new.png" alt="Creating a calendar"/>
	</div>
	<p>Clicking on the 'New' button causes a new calendar to be created.
	</p>
	<p>Before the calendar is created, an input box is displayed
	requesting the new name for the calendar.</p>
	<p>Calendar names must be unique - if the name entered already
	exists, an error is displayed and a new name requested.</p>
	<p>If the calendar name input box is cancelled, the calendar will
	not be created.</p>

	<h3>Configuring a calendar</h3>

	</div>
	<h4>Working Week</h4>
	<p>The working week of a calendar is defined by the days which are
	generally considered working days within the week.</p>
	<p>The days in the working week are chosen by checking the
	appropriate checkboxes.</p>
	<div class="clearer"></div>
	
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/calendar-publicholidays.png"
			alt="Configuring the public holidays"/>
	</div>
	<h4>Public Holidays</h4>
	<p>Blue Prism supports public holidays lists, grouped by country.
	Currently, the public holidays in the following areas are directly
	supported :-</p>
	<ul style="float:left; padding: 0 0 0 2em; margin: 0;">
		<li>England and Wales</li>
		<li>Scotland</li>
		<li>Northern Ireland</li>
		<li>Republic of Ireland</li>
	</ul>
	<p style="clear:left">Selecting the public holiday group will cause
	the appropriate public holidays to be populated into the Public
	Holidays list.</p>
	<p>A public holiday is enabled in a calendar, ie. it will cause a
	day to be treated as a non-working day within a calendar, by ticking
	the checkbox adjacent to its entry in the list.</p>
	<p>You can quickly tick all the listed public holidays by clicking
	on 'Select All'. Likewise, you can untick all listed public holidays
	by clicking 'Select None'.</p>
	
	<div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
		<img src="Graphics/calendar-otherholidays.png"
			alt="Configuring the public holidays"/>
	</div>
	<h4>Other Holidays</h4>
	<p>Any other days to be treated as non-working days can be specified
	in the 'Other Holidays' list.</p>
	<p>To add a holiday, select the appropriate date and click "Add"</p>
	<p>To remove a holiday select the date in the list and click
	"Remove"</p>
