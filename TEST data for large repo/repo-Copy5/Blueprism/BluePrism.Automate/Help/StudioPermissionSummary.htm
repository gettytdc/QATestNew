	</div>

  <h3>Overview</h3>

	<p>The following permissions can be used to control what particular users can do with Objects
     and Processes within Studio (and other parts of the application). Refer to
     <a href="helpUserPermissions.htm">User Permissions</a> for more information about how
     permissions are assigned to users through <a href="frmManageRoles.htm">User Roles.</a></p>

	<table>
	<tr><th>Permission</th><th>Entitlement</th></tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Create</td>
    <td>Users can create items within Studio, including using the Save As option in the editor.
        Edit, Execute and View permissions are also assumed</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Edit</td>
    <td>Users can edit items within Studio and publish/unpublish Processes via AutomateC.
        Execute and View permissions are also assumed</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Execute</td>
    <td>Users can only execute items (i.e. they canâ€™t step into the item while debugging their
        own Object or Process). Execute does not automatically grant View, and users needing to
        open an object/process would require View or Edit permissions</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>View</td>
    <td>Users have a read-only view of items. E.g. right-click from control room or using the
        Object/Process comparison tool. If the user also has the Execute permission, then they
        would be able to step into the item while debugging their own Object or Process.</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Delete</td>
    <td>Users can delete items from within Studio</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Export</td>
    <td>Users can export items from the File menu, Object/process editor, AutomateC or the
        Release tab (assuming they have access to it)</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Import</td>
    <td>Users can import items from the File menu, AutomateC or the Release tab (assuming
    they have access to it)</td>
  </tr>
	<tr>
    <td>Edit Groups</td>
    <td>Users can create/rename/move/delete groups within the Studio tree</td>
  </tr>
