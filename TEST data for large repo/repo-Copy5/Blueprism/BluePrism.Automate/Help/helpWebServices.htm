	<h3>Web Services - Overview</h3>

	<p>Blue Prism provides support for web services in two contexts: web services may be called as
	part of a process in the same way that other business objects are called and Blue Prism can
	expose processes as web services in their own right. Web services exposed by Blue Prism can be
	called remotely.</p>
	
	<p><strong>Note: </strong> In order to expose a process as a web
	service, it must be published, and its name must contain only
	alphanumeric characters - ie. no punctuation or space characters.
	</p>

	<p>Web services should be thought of as a type of <a href="helpBusinessObjects.htm">Business
	Object</a>. Indeed, users in Process Studio will not be able to tell the difference between a
	business object implemented as a web service and a business object implemented as an external
	library. The distinction is drawn in System Manager merely because the configuration options
	available for the two types of Business Object are different.</p>

	<h3>Web Services - Configuration</h3>

	<p>Web services to be made available as business objects may be configured in
	<a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a>. Existing web services are listed in the
	white area; new services may be added by following the <a href="frmWebServices.htm">add a web
	service wizard</a>. Once listed, such services will be visible as business objects from
	<a href="frmProcess.htm">Process Studio</a> and may be called using an
	<a href="frmStageProperties.htm">action stage</a>.</p>

	<p>Services may be enabled or disabled within Blue Prism by adding or removing (respectively) the
	checkmark found by the web service's entry in the list. When disabled, the web service of
	interest will still be visible from Process Studio, but the process will fail to run (be it in
	debug mode or from <a href="frmControlRoom.htm">Control Room</a>) because Blue Prism will deny
	access to the service.</p>
	
	<h3>Web Services - Commandline Configuration</h3>
	<p>Web services may also be registered via the commandline, using the 
	<a href="helpCommandline.htm#Regwebservice">/regwebservice</a> command.
	</p>
	
	
	<h3>Web Services - Glossary</h3>

	<ul>
		<li><b>WSDL</b> - Web Service Description Language. A WSDL document describes the
		capabilities provided by a web service, including what information is expected and what
		information will be returned.</li>

		<li><b>URL</b> - A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a string of characters conforming to a
		standardized format, which refers to a resource on the Internet (such as a document or an
		image) by its location. A URL will be important to Blue Prism to locate a web service or a
		WSDL document.</li>
