    </div>
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
   <p>This document describes mechanisms for controlling a Blue Prism Resource PC
   using HTTP.</p>
   
   <h2>HTTP Mechanisms - overview</h2>
   <p>Communication can be via either <span class="emphasis">HTTP GET</span> or
   <span class="emphasis">HTTP POST</span>. Each mechanism simply wraps the basic
   <a href="helpResourcePCCommands.htm">resource PC commands</a>, which can be
   issued over a telnet interface.</p>
   
   <h3>HTTP GET Requests</h3>
   <p>Commands can be issued in the form of a URL. The command of interest (together
   with the arguments) appears
   as if it were the name of a document to be retrieved. For example the URL:
   <pre class="indented">http://localhost:8181/create%20name%20MyProcess</pre>
   <p>corresponds to the command:</p>
   <pre>create name MyProcess</pre>
   <p>Note that special characters must be escaped - eg the space character must be written
   as %20. Any non alphanumeric characters in a process name for example will also have to be
   escaped. This can be achieved in javascript using the &quot;escape()&quot; function,
   or in the .NET framework using the &quot;System.Web.HttpUtility.UrlEncode()&quot; function.</p>
   <p>Multiple commands can be specified inline. For example, you may authenticate yourself
   (using the <a href="helpResourcePCCommands.htm#user">user</a> and <a href="helpResourcePCCommands.htm#password">password</a>
   commands) and start a process (using the <a href="helpResourcePCCommands.htm#run">run</a> command) all in one go, as follows:</p>
   <pre class="indented">http://localhost:8181/user%20admin&amp;password%20MyPassword&amp;create%20name%20My%20Brilliant%20Process</pre>
   <p>Note that commands are separated by the &amp; character.</p>
   
   <h3>HTTP POST Requests</h3>
   <p>Commands can be issued as parameters within an HTTP POST request. For example
   the following message posted to &quot;/automate&quot; performs authentication
   and starts a process, just as the HTTP GET example above does:</p>
   <pre class="indented">POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8181
User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0
Content-Length: 92
Content-Type: text/plain

param1=user%20admin&amp;param2=password%20MyPassword&amp;param3=create%20name%20My%20Process</pre>
   <p>The naming of parameters is not important, because the Resource PC listener ignores them.</p>
