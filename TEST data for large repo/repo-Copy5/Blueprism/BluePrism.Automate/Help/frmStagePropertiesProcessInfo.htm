    <p>Process Information Stage</p>
  </div>

  <h3 id="overview">Process Information Stage</h3>
  <p>The process information dialog allows you to view and edit the overall
  information regarding the process and how it is referred to and
  handled in other Blue Prism components.</p>

  <h3 id="header">Header Fields</h3>
  <p>Like all stages, the name and the description can be set in the
    header panel. Unlike other stages, the name and description set in
    the process information dialog will set the name and description of
    the process itself.</p>

  <p>Note that any new name value is not reflected in, for instance,
    the window title until the process is saved.</p>

  <h3 id="conditions">Conditions Tab</h3>
  <p>The <code>Conditions</code> tab contains the pre and post
    conditions defined for the process.</p>
  <p>These are entirely documentary, ie. they are not checked by any of
    automation systems used in Blue Prism.</p>
  <p>A condition can be entered by clicking in an empty area of the
    list, and typing in a value. Clicking in an empty area again will
    'commit' the condition to the list.</p>

  <h3 id="information">Information tab</h3>
  <p>The <code>Information</code> contains read-only metadata about the
    process, such as when it was created or last modified and the user
    who was responsible.</p>

  <h4 id="logging">Logging Options</h4>
  <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
    <img src="Graphics/studio-procinfo-logging.png"
      alt="Release Manager Tree"/>
  </div>
  <p>The <code>Logging Options</code> provide the interface to allow the
    behaviour of the logging of the process to be configured.</p>
  <p>With these options, you can elect to terminate a session created
    for a process if any of the logging calls fail. This will ensure
    that the activity of a process is fully audited and it will not
    continue to operate if it is not able to record its activity.</p>
  <p>If any logging errors occur, it will retry a number of times,
    waiting for a defined period in between attempts. Both of these
    values are configurable within this panel.</p>
  <p>Any logging errors which occur on a machine will be written to the
    <code>Blue Prism</code> event log along with a description of how
    many attempts have been made and the source of the problem.</p>
  <p>Equally, if the session is terminated due to unrecoverable logging
    errors, an entry is written to the machines event log detailing the
    termination.</p>
  <p><strong>Note: </strong> these options only apply to the root
    process - ie. the master process registered to run on the resource
    when the session is created. Any options set within subprocesses
    called within a session will have no effect on that session's
    logging configuration.</p>

  <h3 id="footer">Footer Fields</h3>
  <p>The <code>Help</code> button on the form displays this help page.
  </p>

  <p>Although the <code>Disable all logging on this stage</code>
    checkbox is visible, it will have no effect in any sessions for
    the process information stage.</p>

  <p>Processes are not visible in <code>Control Room</code> unless they
    are 'published'. The published state of a process can be viewed or
    set using the <code>Publish this Process to Control Room</code>
    checkbox in the footer of the process information stage dialog.</p>
