<p>Ken Boon (Elphick) and Harry Crawford (Daker) were both old-fashioned "smokeys" (firemen) in the <a href="/wiki/West_Midlands_Fire_Service" title="West Midlands Fire Service">West Midlands Fire Service</a>, Crawford took early retirement and moved to <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a> to open a bar, leaving Ken behind. Ken went to a fire where a child was trapped upstairs. Rather than waiting for breathing apparatus to arrive, he went into the house and rescued the child but was severely injured by inhaling toxic smoke. He was declared unfit for duty after collapsing during a drill because his lungs had been permanently damaged so he had no choice but to leave the fire service for good.</p>

<p>He started a market garden called "The Ponderosa" in a village about ten miles outside <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> but found that it wasn't working out. As he struggled to pay bills and keep afloat, he was surprised when a visitor arrived at the garden: Harry had returned from Spain to Birmingham, after his wife Alison had left him for a young hairdresser. Harry had acquired a hotel in Birmingham and offered a port in a storm for Ken.</p>
<p>Ken was convinced into placing a PO box advert in "Box 13" saying “Ex-fireman seeks interesting work. Anything legal considered.” From these humble beginnings, his career as a courier, minder and private investigator began.</p>
<p>During the time that Ken and Harry worked together, Harry ran two hotels (The Grand Hotel and The Coaching Inn), a ballroom (The Plaza Suite), a country club (Woodcote Park) and a security firm (CBS - Crawford Boon Security). Ken ran a motorbike courier firm (Texas Rangers), two private investigation firms (BDI - Boon-Daly Investigations - and Boon Investigations) and CBS. CBS was a joint venture, with Ken being responsible for private investigations and Harry for security.</p>
<p>The series moved away from <a href="/wiki/Birmingham" title="Birmingham">Birmingham</a> to <a href="/wiki/Nottingham" title="Nottingham">Nottingham</a> at the beginning of series 4, with production of the show being based at Central's studio in Nottingham. The Birmingham episodes (Series 1-3) were made on film whereas the Nottingham episodes (Series 4-7) were made on video. Apart from studio interiors of Series 1, all filming was done on location <a href="http://fp.martinunderwood.f9.co.uk/Boon/location.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://fp.martinunderwood.f9.co.uk/Boon/location.htm" rel="nofollow">[1]</a>.<br /></p>

<p>At the end of the final series, in episode "Shot in the Dark", Harry got engaged to an Irish woman whom he met during a case, and Ken and Alex seemed to be becoming romantically attached after she tenderly read him poetry <a href="http://fp.martinunderwood.f9.co.uk/Boon/series7/alexpoem.htm" class="external autonumber" title="http://fp.martinunderwood.f9.co.uk/Boon/series7/alexpoem.htm" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> while was in hospital recovering from gunshot wounds. Neither of these plot developments were referred to during the special episode "Thieves Like Us", broadcast three years later on 1 May 1995. This episode, although thought to be part of an eighth series which was cancelled, was actually an episode from the final series which had not been aired.</p>
<p>In all, seven series, each of which consisted of 13 episodes (apart from the last two series which had 14) were filmed. The sixth series featured a 90-minute Christmas special which was dedicated to the memory of Bill Stair, one of the show's creators.</p>

<p>Trivia: The episode 'Thieves Like Us' was listed as 'The Last Episode', but the storyline tells us that it was meant to be broadcast during the original syndication of series 7, and obviously prior to the episode 'Shot in the Dark'. Within the episode 'Shot in the Dark', there were subjects that were touched on, such as Ken's blossoming romance with Alex Wilton, and Harry's "news" for Ken, which we never got to hear, nor was it mentioned in 'Thieves Like Us'. When 'Thieves Like Us' was broadcast, the announcer referred to it as a 'One-Off-Special'. The reason for delayed airing has never been explained.</p>

<p>Music was a huge part of the series. A large reason for its popularity was the catchy theme song 'Hi Ho Silver' which was written and recorded by <a href="/wiki/Jim_Diamond_(Scottish_musician)" title="Jim Diamond (Scottish musician)">Jim Diamond</a>, who was by that time famous for his Number 1 hits '<a href="/wiki/I_Won%27t_Let_You_Down" title="I Won't Let You Down">I Won't Let You Down</a>' and '<a href="/wiki/I_Should_Have_Known_Better_(Jim_Diamond_song)" title="I Should Have Known Better (Jim Diamond song)">I Should Have Known Better</a>'. It was so popular with fans that it was released as a single in 1986 and reached number 5 in the UK charts. Most of the episodes however, didn't end with the theme song, many of them ended with country and western songs such as 'Handsome Stranger' and 'Texas Rangers', written for the series by <a href="/wiki/Dean_Friedman" title="Dean Friedman">Dean Friedman</a>. Friedman wrote the incidental music and songs from series 2 through to the end of the show.

He also wore this for a lot of series 3. For Series 4 and 5 he wore a black jacket. Series 6 was a brown suede jacket. Series 7 was a regular leather jacket.</p>
<p>Rocky Cassidy's trademark for most of the series was his studded leather jacket, which also featured his name "Rocky" studded on the back. He also wore leather trousers.</p>
<p>Harry was usually seen in a grey or black suit of some sort.</p>

<p>According to Jim Hill (co-creator), the name "Boon" was derived as follows: "Originally called "Anything Legal Considered", we fell foul of the vogue of the main character's name being all or part of the title. Boon had been derived from an American TV series from the 1950s that Bill Stair and I both watched and liked. It was called "Have Gun - Will Travel" (1957) - a troubleshooting cowboy answered distress calls. He was called Paladin and was played by the actor Richard Boone. We dropped the E and we had BOON - a modern-day trouble shooter on a motorbike instead of a steed."</p>
