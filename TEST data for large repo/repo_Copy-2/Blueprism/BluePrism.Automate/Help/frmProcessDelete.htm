    <h3>Delete an Existing Process</h3>

    <p>If you need to delete a process, the delete option will remove the process from the
    database, but only processes that have not been run may be deleted, as once run they are
    required for audit purposes. Follow the steps on-screen to delete a process as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Locate a process</h3>

        <p>A list of existing processes from the database is presented with name, version and
        description details listed. The information in the box can be sorted according to each
        column by clicking the appropriate heading.</p>

        <p>To select a process to delete, simply highlight the entry required using the mouse.</p>

        <h3>2. Delete a process</h3>

        <p>Once you have completed step 1 clicking OK will delete the selected process from the
        database. The dialog will remain open so that you can delete another process. Click Cancel
        when you have finished deleting processes.</p>
