	<p><strong>Note: </strong> This mechanism has largely been
	superseded by the <a href="relman.html">Release Manager</a>. For
	specific details about importing a process see the help
	documentation for the <a href="relman-import-release.html">Import
	Release</a> wizard.<br/>
	This documentation remains for the editions of Blue Prism in which
	the Release Manager is unavailable.</p>

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>The process import feature allows you to import a process or
    (<a href="helpBusinessObjects.htm#VBO">visual business object</a>) which was created within a different
    <a href="helpConnections.htm">Blue Prism database</a>. This is particularly useful if you have
    separate databases for testing and production environments, and you wish to transfer changes made
    in the test environment into the production environment. Using the Process Import wizard is quick
    and simple.
    </p>
    <p>
		The task is summarised by the following flow chart. Each step is annotated below.

	</p>
	

	<h3>1. Choose a file to import</h3>

	<p>A file name for the process must be specified. Click browse and navigate to the location
	of the file you wish to import. The file must contain a process or business object which has
	been <a href="frmProcessExport.htm">exported</a> from another database.</p>

	<div class="indented">
	<h3 id="IDConflict">1a. Resolve ID conflicts, where necessary</h3>
	<p>
	   Each process and business object has an internal ID which it retains when it is exported.
	   Each process and business object must have an ID which is unique amongst all other processes
	   and business objects in the same database. The ID is used for several purposes, including maintaining
	   references in <a href="frmStagePropertiesSubProcess.htm">Sub-Process Stages</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	   A naming conflict usually occurs when you export a process from a live environment, make some
	   modifications to it in a test environment, and then want to propagate those changes back to the
	   live environment by importing it. In this case you should choose to overwrite the existing process
	   with the incoming process. This will maintain the sequence of edits in the
	   <a href="helpProcessHistory.htm">process' history</a>. Any sub-process references made in other
	   processes (or business objects) will point to the latest version of the process, in its newly imported state.
	 </p>
	 <p>
		Alternatively, you may choose a new ID for the incoming process, which will mean that the two processes
		will co-exist, under different names (the wizard will enforce the choice of a new name for the incoming process).
		In this case, sub-process references made in other processes (or business objects) will point to the original
		process, rather than the newly imported one.
	  </p>
	  </div>
	  
	  
	  <h3>2. Enter a process name</h3>
	  <p>
		The name for the process from the original file will be shown. This name can be left as
		it is but if you wish to change or update it, the name can contain any characters, including
		spaces. The name can only be up to 128 characters long.
	  </p>
	  <p>
		The chosen name must not conflict with any existing name in the database (except perhaps in the case
		when a process is to be written over an existing process in the database, as in the case of an
		<a href="#IDConflict">ID conflict</a>).
	   </p>
	   <p>
		If you are overwriting an existing process, the name you choose here will be the name of that process,
		in its latest form: that is, the existing process will be both overwritten and renamed.
	   </p>
	   
	   <div class="indented">
	   <h3 id="NameConflict">2a. Resolve naming conflicts, where necessary</h3>
	   <p>
			If your chosen name for the process conflicts with the name of an existing process, then you must
			either click the &quot;Back&quot; button and choose another name, or you must choose from the
			options presented. 
		</p>
		<p>
			If you have chosen to overwrite an existing process, because of an <a href="#IDConflict">ID conflict</a>,
			then your only further option will be to rename the existing process, to make way for the incoming process.
			In all other cases, you will have the option to overwrite the existing process.
		</p>
		</div>
		
	<h3>3. Enter a process description</h3>
	<p>The description of the business process can be up to 1000 characters long, and will be
	shown on a note field at the top of the finished process flowchart.</p>

	<h3>4. Continue to Process Studio</h3>

	<p>Once you have completed steps 1,2 and 3, your choices will be actioned, and irreversibly applied.
	You will then be presented with the option to open the imported process in <a href="frmProcess.htm">process studio</a>, after the wizard
	closes.
