	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
	<p><a href="helpQueues.htm">Work Queues</a>
	provide a mechanism for modelling the queueing, locking and
	reporting of work items within a Blue Prism environment.</p>
	
	<h3 id="items">Items</h3>
	<p>A work item contains a text key value to identify it amongst
	other items in the queue, a numeric priority, a text state value
	which can give some indication of the current state of the item, a
	set of text tags which can give more fine-grained information about
	the nature of the item and arbitrary data in the form of a
	collection.</p>
	
	<p>When first created on a queue, an item has a workflow status of
	<code>Pending</code>. When selected to be worked by a process, it is
	<code>Locked</code>, following which the process can elect to set
	the workflow status of the item to <code>Completed</code> (to
	indicate that the item has been processed successfully), <code>
	Exceptioned</code> (to indicate that the item has failed in some way
	while attempting to process it) or <code>Deferred</code> (to defer
	processing of the item until a later date).</p>
	
	<p>An item contains various metadata which be modified while it is
	being processed. The (text) status can be modified to indicate a
	simple status of the item. Tags can be added or removed to an item,
	allowing for categorisation of work items within a queue. Note that
	the key value cannot be changed once the item has been created.</p>
	
	<h3 id="queues">Queues</h3>	
	<p>A queue contains any number of work items which are passed out to
	consuming processes in order of priority, then in the order that
	they were added to the queue.</p>
	
	<p>The queue which contains the work items is configured in <a
	href="sysman-queues.html">System Manager - Workflow</a>.
	The key field for the queue indicates which field in a new item's
	data collection should be co-opted to use as the key value for the
	item. This can be left blank to indicate that no items should have
	key values in this queue.</p>
	
	<p>A queue can be configured to automatically requeue items which
	were marked with an exception a specified number of times. By
	default, items are not set to retry at all - ie. an exception is
	considered to be the end of processing for that item.</p>
	
	<p>A queue can be configured to automatically encrypt its contents
	using a predefined <a href="helpEncryption.htm">encryption scheme</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="howto">Using queues within processes</h3>
	<p>A work item can be created on the queue within a process by
	calling the <code>Add to Queue</code> action on the <code>Internal -
	Work Queues</code> business object.</p>
	
	<p>Only one process / visual business object within a session can
	work a queue item at any given time - that item is locked for use by
	that process/VBO within its session by calling the <code>Get Next
	</code> action on the <code>Internal - Work Queues</code> business
	object. Only a process/VBO with such a lock can update the workflow
	status of the item.</p>
	
	<p>You can filter the items to retrieve by key or by the presence or
	absence of a specific tag, by giving the appropriate arguments to
	the <code>Get Next</code> action.</p>
	
	<p>Full documentation for the work queues business object actions
	can be found by clicking on the information icon : <img
	src="Graphics/icon-info.png" title="Info" /> in the action
	properties dialog within Process Studio</p>
	
	<h3>Monitoring work queues</h3>
	<p>The queues and their items can be monitored and, to a certain
	extent, altered using the <a href="control-queues.html">
	Queue Management</a> tab of Control Room.</p>
