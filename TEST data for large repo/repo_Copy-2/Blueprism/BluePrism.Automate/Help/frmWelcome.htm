    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>The Blue Prism user interface is designed to help you quickly and easily, create and implement
    business processes, without having to resort to costly back-end integration, or software
    development.</p>

    <p>The suite of Blue Prism modules empowers the user to create processes in order to design and
    test automated tasks, whilst providing a comprehensive control and report area, in order to
    implement and monitor those tasks in the real world.</p>

    <p>The home page is always shown when signing in to the client application, and displays the
    current <a href="sysman-settings.html">environment name</a> and the user's default
    <a href="dashboards-ui.htm">dashboard.</a> The navigation bar on the left, and the tab bars
    at the top of the screen provide access to other parts of the application.</p>
