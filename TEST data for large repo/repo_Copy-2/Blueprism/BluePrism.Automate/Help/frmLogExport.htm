    <h3>Exporting a log</h3>

    <p>The first step in exporting a log is to open the log in the <a href="frmLogsViewer.htm">Log
    Viewer</a> and to choose the desired export option from the file menu.</p>

    <p>Next you must choose your desired file format. Three file formats are available: plain text
    file (as you see on the log viewer itself); html file (suitable for markup in a web browser);
    and csv file (standing for comma separated values, this file format is designed for formatting
    tabular data making it suitable for use in a spreadsheet). If you choose either html or csv,
    the data in each row of the log will be separated into distinct columns of message datetime,
    message and stageid (where appropriate). If you are unsure of which file format to choose, then
    choose the default of text (.txt).</p>

    <p>You must also decide at the first step whether you wish to include stage IDs. A brief
    description of stage IDs is given in the help page for the <a href="frmLogsViewer.htm">Log
    Viewer</a>. If you do not understand what the stage IDs are for, you probably don't want to
    include them. However if you intend to send the exported log to Blue Prism for technical
    support, then you should include the stage IDs.</p>

    <p>After clicking next you will be prompted to enter a file name for the exported log. You may
    type this directly or browse for a particular location. If you use the browse feature then a
    suggested filename will be provided, based on the ID of the session and the date on which it
    was run.</p>

    <p>After clicking next, the progress of the export process will be given via a progress bar. If
    your log is large or your database server is under heavy load, you may need to be patient.
    Whilst waiting for the export to proceed, you may return to the log viewer (or indeed any other
    part of Blue Prism) and continue to work.</p>
