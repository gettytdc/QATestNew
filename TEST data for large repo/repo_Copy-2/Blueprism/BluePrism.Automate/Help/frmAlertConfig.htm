    <h3>Process Alerts Configuration</h3>
	<p>
		This page describes how users can amend their preferences for process alerts. You
		may wish to read the <a href="helpProcessAlerts.htm">Process Alerts overview</a>
		first.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Opening the Configuration Window</h3>
	<p>
		The configuration window can be opened either from the context menu of the task tray icon
		(see <a href="helpProcessAlerts.htm">Process Alerts overview</a> for details), or from
		<a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a>. The former method allows the
		current user's settings to be changed only; the latter allows a system administrator to 
		change the settings of any user.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Choosing Processes</h3>
	<p>
		At the top of the configuration form is a list of Blue Prism Processes. Note that only
		<a href="frmStagePropertiesProcessInfo.htm#Publishing">published processes</a> will appear
		in this list. You should place a tick beside each process for which you are interested
		in receiving alerts. You may choose as few or as many processes as you please.
	</p>
	
	<h3>Choosing Alert Types</h3>
    <p>
		You may choose to be alerted when a variety of process-related events occur. 
		The available events of interest are as follows.
	</p>
    <dl class="Indented">
        <dt>Pending</dt><dd>When a pending session is created</dd>
        <dt>Running</dt><dd>When a process starts</dd>
        <dt>Complete</dt><dd>When a process completes</dd>
        <dt>Terminated</dt><dd>When a session is terminated,
			due to an unhandled <a href="helpExceptions.htm">exception</a> in the process</dd>
        <dt>Stopped</dt><dd>When a process is stopped</dd>
        <dt>Stage</dt><dd>When a process reaches an alert stage</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>
		You may choose to receive a particular alert type by placing a tick in
		the appropriate box.
	</p>
	     
    <h3>Choosing Alert Methods</h3>
    <p>
		You may choose to be alerted via one or more methods. They are as follows:
	</p>
    <dl class="Indented">
		<dt>Popup</dt><dd>A transient notification window which briefly appears
		at the corner of the screen.</dd>
		<dt>Show History</dt><dd>The config window appears with the history tab focused, and remains on the screen
		until the user closes it.</dd>
		<dt>Notification Icon</dt><dd>The icon in the windows task tray changes
		appearance, from a red bell <img style="display:inline" src="graphics/alerts icon - red.png" alt="Alerts icon - red configuration" />
		(normal) to an orange bell <img style="display:inline" src="graphics/alerts icon - orange.png" alt="Alerts icon - orange configuration" />
		(indicating that an alert
		has arrived). The details of the alert become visible when the user double clicks the icon.</dd>
		<dt>Sound</dt><dd>Blue Prism will play a sound each time an alert is received. This is subject
		to the correct hardware being installed on your computer (including sound card and speakers)
		and the volume being audible.</dd>
	</dl>
	 <p>
		You may choose to be alerted by one or more methods by placing a tick in the
		appropriate box(es).
	</p>
    	
    <h3>Alert History</h3>
    <p>
		A history of process alerts can be viewed on the process alert configuration form.
		The current day's alerts are displayed by default and the user can navigate to previous
		days as required. An export facility also allows a day of alerts to be saved to file. Alert
		history will be maintained until the user archives the related session logs. Note however
		that unlike archived log data, alert history can not be restored once the session files
		have been archived.
	</p>
