	<h2>Credentials Management</h2>
	<p>In System Manager, in the Security module, a tab labelled Credentials provides access to the main
	 management interface. From here, the details of the existing credentials stored in the database can
	 be seen, although the password can never be viewed or retrieved via the user interface. The existing
	 items can be deleted or amended, and new ones can be added. For each item, permissions can be set 
	allowing access to those credentials based on the requesting Process, User and Resource.</p>
	
	<h3>New</h3>
	<p>To create a new Credential click the link labelled New. The <a href="frmCredentials.htm">Credential Details</a> 
	form will then be displayed, where you can enter the details of the new Credential.</p>
	
	<h3>Edit</h3>
	<p>To edit a Credential Select a credential in the listview and click the link labelled Edit, or double click 
	the credential in the listview that you wish to edit. The <a href="frmCredentials.htm">Credential Details</a> 
	form will then be displayed, where you can edit the details of the existing Credential.</p>
	
	<h3>Delete</h3>
	<p>To delete one or many credentials, select the credential or credentials that you wish to delete and then
	click the link labelled Delete.</p>
