    <h3>Breakpoint Properties</h3>

    <p>The breakpoint properties form allows you to determine the conditions under which a
    breakpoint will be triggered at run time. A data item can cause the debug flow to break under a
    variety of scenarios:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            When the data item is accessed 

            <p>Any time the data item is read (eg when it is used in a calculation or when it is
            passed as an input to an action stage) the breakpoint will fire after that stage has
            completed.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            When the data item is changed 

            <p>Each time the data item changes value, the breakpoint will fire immediately after
            the stage that changed it.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            When the data item is changed, subject to conditions 

            <p>You may optionally supply an additional condition. The breakpoint will only fire when
            the data item changes value, and the additional condition is also met. This additional
            condition may be an expression of any type; it need not simply examine the new value of
            the data item. The breakpoint will fire immediately after the stage which changed
            it.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
