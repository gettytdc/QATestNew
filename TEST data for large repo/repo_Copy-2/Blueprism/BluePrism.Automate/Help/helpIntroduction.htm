    <h3>About Blue Prism...</h3>
    <p>At Blue Prism we developed Robotic Process Automation software to provide businesses
    and organizations like yours with a more agile digital workforce. A digital workforce
    that could be more cost effective, that could follow rules-based business processes and
    interact with systems in the same way that everyday users do. We help you to create a
    digital workforce that is secure, consistent, reliable and scalable. And one that frees
    up your very best people to focus on the tasks at which they excel. How do we do all of
    this? We have created Software Robots, what we like to call the Digital Workforce.</p>

    <h3>What is Robotic Process Automation?</h3>
    <p>Robotic Process Automation provides organizations like yours with an agile digital
    workforce that follows rule-based business processes and interacts with the systems in
    the same way that existing users currently do. Blue Prism enables this, but in a way that
    is far more efficient. It’s also secure, consistent, reliable and scalable. Importantly
    Blue Prism complements traditional IT solutions such as BPM and front office productivity
    tools. It provides a universal and consistent back office automation platform with embedded
    controls and governance that is code-free and managed by the organization itself.</p>

        <td class="intro" style="text-align: center;">In a perfect world your people interact with customers, have ideas and make improvements,
        while IT implements business rules and logic, bulk processing and consistent decisions. In the
        real world, IT has not traditionally been capable of adapting or developing at the speed business
        needs. So your people end up filling the gaps between systems and processes – taking them away
        from the really valuable work.</td>
        <td style="border: 0px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
        <td class="intro" style="text-align: center;">With Blue Prism your people really do get on with interacting with customers, making judgements
        and improving the business. And your Robotic Process Automation technology actually does implement
        business rules and logic, bulk processing and consistent decisions. How? The Blue Prism Digital
        Workforce provides you with an enterprise-strength technology solution that supports the pace of
        business change.</td>

    <h3>Meet the Digital Workforce</h3>
    <p>Think of Blue Prism’s Software Robots as the Digital Workforce. It is a workforce which
    enables organizations like yours to automate existing user actions, just as if the user
    were moving through and across their current raft of applications. Our Enterprise platform
    provides a capability for automating processes that would otherwise be executed manually by
    humans, or by customizing existing IT systems. When adopted alongside traditional IT
    development, Blue Prism extends the reach of technology with a higher level of automation, a
    significantly lower level of investment and greater speed to deployment.</p>
