		<h2>Windows Vista / 7 User Account Control</h2>
	</div>

	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Windows Vista introduced 'User Account Control' to the Windows
		environment - a mechanism by which changes to the system which
		affect all users can be controlled by requesting elevated
		privileges when such changes are made.</p>
	
	<h3>How this affects the Blue Prism software</h3>
	<p>From a Blue Prism perspective, this affects any of the following
		configuration changes :-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The list of database / server connections which the client
			and resource PCs connect to.</li>
		<li>Whether a resource machine runs when the Blue Prism client
			application is started up on a machine</li>
		<li>The external business objects registered on a machine</li>
		<li>The Blue Prism server configurations defined on a machine
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>If Blue Prism is running as an administrator (<i>ie.</i> the
		program is configured to always 'Run As Administrator'), then
		it will save the configuration with no further prompting from
		the user.</p>
	<p>If the application is running under normal privileges, the user
		will receive an elevation prompt the first time the machine
		configuration needs to be saved. If accepted, a separate program
		called <code>AutomateConfig</code> will be run and will remain
		running as long as the Blue Prism client is running.</p>
	<p>You can tell when AutomateConfig is running by looking in the
		notification area (the lower right of the screen). There will
		be a Blue Prism icon with a small cog overlaid on it.</p>
	<p>If the program remains open longer than it should, it can be
		closed by right-clicking the icon and choosing <code>Exit</code>
	</p>
