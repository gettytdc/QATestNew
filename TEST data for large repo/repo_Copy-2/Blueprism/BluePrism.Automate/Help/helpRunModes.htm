    <h3>Blue Prism Resource PC Modes</h3>
    <p>Blue Prism has several modes of operation, each of which can be selected using command-line
    options. See the <a href="helpCommandLine.htm">command-line reference</a> for full details of these options.</p>

	<a href="InteractiveMode" id="InteractiveMode"></a>
    <h3>Interactive Mode</h3>
    <p>Normally, Blue Prism runs in interactive mode. While running in interactive mode, the local PC
    is available as a Resource PC only to the user logged in to Blue Prism at the time. Only one
    interactive session may run on a PC at any one time.</p>
    <p>
		The interactive run mode may be disabled via <a href="helpSystemManagerSettings.htm">System Manager</a> in System, Settings,
		(uncheck "Start the process engine on this machine when users sign in") in order to avoid it conflicting with the 
		<a href="#ResourcePCMode">Resource PC</a> mode, for example).
	</p>

	<a href="ResourcePCMode" id="ResourcePCMode"></a>
    <h3>Resource PC Mode</h3>
    <p>In Resource PC mode, Blue Prism functions as a Resource PC, listening for instructions from
    remote instances of Control Room. A Resource PC can be <span class="emphasis">public</span> (any Blue Prism user can
    start processes from any PC), <span class="emphasis">local</span> (the resource PC is only visible from the local
    machine), or <span class="emphasis">exclusive</span> to a particular user. In order to run more than one Resource PC
	on a single machine (or to run a Resource PC at the same time as running in Interactive mode), any additional Resource PC
	instances must be launched specifying a different port number.  See the <a href="helpCommandLine.htm">command-line reference</a> 
	for full details </p>

	<a href="CommandMode" id="CommandMode"></a>
    <h3>Command Mode</h3>
    <p>In command mode, Blue Prism is launched from the command line to perform an operation on a
    remote (or local!) Resource PC. Once the command has been sent, Blue Prism terminates. There is
    no restriction on the number of simultaneous instances in command mode and command mode can be
    used while Blue Prism is already running in Interactive Mode, or Resource PC Mode.</p>
