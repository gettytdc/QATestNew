    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
        General environment-wide settings are configured in the
        'Settings' section of System Manager.
    </p>
    <p>
        It allows you to manage the autosaving and summarising
        requirements of Blue Prism components, the running of an
        internal Runtime Resource when the client is used, and the theming of the
        environment.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <code>System - Settings</code> permission is required in
        order to view or alter any of these settings.
    </p>

    <h3>Local Device Settings</h3>
    <dl class="listplease">
        <dt>Personal Runtime Resource</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                While the Blue Prism client is logged in, an embedded runtime
                resource is automatically operated and available for use by the user
                logged into the client. Note that this is <em>not</em> a
                publicly available resource - it can only be used by the current
                logged in user.
            </p>
            <p>
                To disable this Runtime Resource, uncheck the <code>
                    Start a personal Runtime resource on this machine when users sign in
                </code> checkbox.
                <strong>Note: </strong> This disables the embedded resource on this
                machine for all Blue Prism environments, not just the currently
                logged in environment.
            </p>

    <h3>System Wide Settings</h3>
    <h4>General</h4>
    <dl class="listplease">
        <dt id="autosave">Backups and Autosaving</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                By default, Blue Prism will automatically save any changes made
                while editing processes and objects in Design Studio.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can alter the frequency of the autosave, or disable it
                altogether via the <code>
                    Automatically back up when editing a
                    process or business object
                </code> option.
            </p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="summary">Enforcing Change Summaries</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                When a user saves any changes made to a Process or Business
                Object, you can optionally require the user to summarise their
                changes using the <code>
                    Force users to summarise their changes
                    when saving a process or business object
                </code> option.
            </p><p>
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, a user is required to summarise their changes when
                saving.
            </p><p>
            </p>
        </dd>

        <dt id="allowpaste">Allowing Password Pasting</dt>
        <dd>
            Generally, a user is able to paste a password from the
            clipboard into a password entry box in the Blue Prism
            client software. In so doing, this will expose the plain
            text of the password in managed memory. This option allows
            an administrator to inhibit the behaviour, meaning that
            the box will not allow itself to be populated with pasted
            data.
			</p><p>
        </dd>

		<dt id="allowpaste">Allow latest Runtime Resource capture</dt>
        <dd>
            This enables an administrator to dictate whether or not a user
			may configure an exception stage to capture and store a screenshot
			when an error occurs. This screenshot is then viewable through
			control room.
			</p><p>
        </dd>

		<dt id="warning">Default Session Warning Time</dt>
        <dd>
            This allows an administrator to set the default amount of time
			(in minutes) that a session can remain on the same stage, before
			it is shown as a warning in control room.

			A setting of 0 will disable any session being shown as a warning.

        </dd>

    <h4>Runtime Resource Connectivity</h4>
    <dl class="listplease">
        <dt id="require-secure">Require Secure Inbound Instructional Connections</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Specifies that Blue Prism clients and Blue Prism Servers will only be able to establish connections
                with Runtime Resources that are configured to apply certificate-based encryption. Additionally, where
                this setting is enabled, Runtime Resources will only be able to establish a connection with the platform
                if they are configured to apply certificate-based encryption.
            </p>
            <p>
                This does not apply to the Runtime Resources that can be automatically started locally when a user logs
                in to the Blue Prism client.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="allow-anon">Allow Anonymous Resources</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Specifies that public Runtime Resources do not need to explicitly authenticate to connect to the environment.</p>
        </dd>
	<dt id="allow-screencapture">Allow latest Runtime Resource screen capture</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>Specifies that screen captures may be taken by Runtime Resources.</p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="prevent-registration">Prevent Registration of New Runtime Resources</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Used to only allow Runtime Resources which have been previously registered in the database to
                establish a connection with the environment. This prevents previously unregistered devices from
                establishing a successful connection.
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="enforce-permissions">Session Management Enforces Permissions of Controlling User</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                Enabled by default. When enabled, when session control actions are requested the permissions
                of the controlling user will be validated. If disabled, the session control actions validate
                the permissions of the account used to authenticate the Runtime Resource against the environment.</p>
            <p>
                It is recommended that this setting is enabled. When enabled, the create, start and delete
                resource pc commands are no longer valid. They are replaced by the commands: createas, startas, deleteas
            </p>
        </dd>
        <dt id="registration">Resource Registration and Addressing</dt>
        <dd>
            </p>
            <p>System Administrators can optionally change this setting if appropriate for deployment:</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Register and communicate using the machine (short) name (default)</li>
                    <li>Register using machine (short) name, communicate using FQDN*</li>
                    <li>Register and communicate using FQDN</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <i>
                    *if a device registers which matches a previously registered machine name but does not have a
                    matching FQDN, the connection will be rejected. In this scenario the FQDN associated with the
                    short-name can be reset within Resource Management.
                </i>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Register:</strong> The name format used when registering Runtime Resources is the
                one which is featured when managing and configuring the platform (e.g. within session logs,
                schedules and control room etc.).
            </p>
            <p>
                Changing the name format used for registering components will require each to register as new
                devices within the environment meaning that any previous Runtime Resource configuration may need
                to be repeated (e.g. configuring Resource Groups and Resource Pools, assigning access to
                credentials, schedule configuration etc.).
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>Connect:</strong> The name format used when connecting to the devices and is therefore
                the name that must be resolvable to an IP address from each of the devices where connections can
                be initialized.
            </p>
        </dd>
    </dl>

     <h4>Database</h4>
    <dl class="listplease">
        <dt id="unicode">Unicode Support for Session Logs</dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                By default, session logs are stored in the database in non-unicode
                format. You can enable the capability to store additional characters
                in these logs by using the <code>
                    Enable Unicode support for session
                    logs
                </code> option.
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to enabling this setting, it should be noted that Unicode
                logging will require increased amounts of SQL disk space for the storage
                of all new session logs. Additionally, reverting this change once
                Unicode logging has taken place will require manual intervention as well
                as potentially significant system downtime (any Unicode logs will need
                to be removed from the database using the <a href="helpArchiving.htm">
                    archiving
                </a> facility beforehand).
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> This setting can only be changed while there are no
                pending	or running sessions.
            </p>
        </dd>
    </dl>


        <h3 id="theme">Environment Themes</h3>
        <p>
            A basic 'theme' can be configured for an environment by selecting
            a foreground and background colour for title labels and status
            bars.
        </p>
        <p>
            The colours can be chosen from a predefined list of colours in
            the <code>Background</code> and <code>Foreground</code> drop
            down menus.
        </p>
        <p>
            The chosen colours will display in the <code>Preview</code> box
            and the changes can be applied by pressing the associated
            <code>Apply</code> button.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that changes will be applied to the Blue Prism client window
            immediately, but any open Design Studio windows will not reflect
            the changes until they are closed and reopened. Equally, other
            logged in users will not see the change until they sign out and
            sign back into the environment.
        </p>
