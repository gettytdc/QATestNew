    <h3>Optical Character Recognition (OCR)</h3>
    <p>An OCR engine is available within Blue Prism for situations where it is
    not appropriate to use the native character recognition engine to interact
    with on-screen text. Commonly this will include scenarios such as where
    smoothed-text is enforced; or for interacting with scanned or
    otherwise-restricted copies of electronic documents.</p>
    
    <p>The Blue Prism capability uses an embedded Tesseract OCR engine to
    recognise text using pattern matching and complex, language-based text
    recognition.</p>
    
    <p>In order to maximise the effectiveness of the recognition a minimum of
    300 dots-per-inch (dpi) is required. For images, such as on-screen text,
    where the dpi is lower than this, a Scale parameter will artificially
    increase the size of the captured region before passing it to the engine.
    Generally setting the scale factor to 4 or 5 will provide successful results.
    </p>

    <p>The OCR engine is leveraged though a <a href="frmStagePropertiesRead.htm">Read</a>
    stage when used against a previously captured Application Modeller region
    and includes the options to read text, lists and grids. It is also possible
    to output the pre-worked images to a specific diagnostics location to allow
    verification that the scaling being applied is sufficient for the selected
    region.</p>

    <h5 id="lang">Language Packs</h5>
    <p>Language packs for use with Tesseract can be obtained from the
    internet. Blue Prism works with Tesseract version 4.0.0 and it is
    imperative that the correct major version of the language files are used
    with it. Currently, the version 4.0.0 language files can be downloaded from
    the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/wiki/Data-Files">Tesseract website</a>.</p>

    <p>To add support for another language, download the appropriate files and
    copy them to the Tesseract\tessdata folder (usually
    <code>C:\Program Files\Blue Prism Limited\Blue Prism Automate\Tesseract\tessdata</code>).
    </p>

    <p>The language files are prefixed with a language code e.g fra (French),
    deu (German), jpn (Japanese), chi-tra (Traditional Chinese) etc. Once
    installed on each of the required devices, this code can be specified in the
    Language parameter of the "Read Text with OCR" action within a
    <a href="frmStagePropertiesRead.htm">Read</a> stage, to instruct the engine
    to use the required pack.</p>

    <h5 id="lang">Page Segmentation Mode</h5>
    <p>The "Read Text with OCR" action within a <a href="frmStagePropertiesRead.htm">Read</a>
    stage has an optional text parameter Page Segmentation Mode, allowing a
    Tesseract-defined value to be specified. The values which can be entered in
    this parameter are shown below, along with a brief description of their
    action.</p>

    <p>If no value is entered for the Page Segmentation Mode, then the default
    value of Auto will be used.

        official documentation provided by Tesseract on their website.
