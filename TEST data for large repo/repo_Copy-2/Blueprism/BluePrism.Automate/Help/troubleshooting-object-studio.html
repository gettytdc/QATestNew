	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>This page provides some common issues and suggested resolutions
	for using the Object Studio feature of Blue Prism</p>


	<h5>Immediately after spying an application element, Blue Prism fails to highlight
	it for me</h5>
	<p>This problem is due to a misunderstanding of how application elements are identified in the
	target application. The spy tool gathers information (a list of
	<a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#Attributes">attributes</a>) about the target element and
	presents it in the list.</p>

	<p>By default, some of the more useful attributes will be marked as
	<span class="emphasis">required</span> and others will not. This selection does not represent a
	definitive set of attributes known to be suitable for identifying the element; rather it merely
	a guess. It is up to the user to review the list, and select the best set of attributes for the
	element in question.</p>

	<p>See <a href="helpChoosingRequiredAttributes.htm">choosing required attributes</a> for more
	information.</p>


	<h5>My business object worked when I tested it last, but after reloading my object
	it no longer seems to work</h5>
	<p>Each time you reload the target application, features of its elements may change both
	dramatically and subtly. For example the
	<a href="attributes.htm#WindowText">text on a button</a> may change from
	"Update" to "Commit" (a dramatic change) or, the order in which an element was created (known
	as the <a href="attributes.htm#Ordinal">ordinal</a>) may have changed (a
	subtle change).</p>

	<p>As a business object designer, you need to take care to mark as
	<span class="emphasis">required</span> only those attributes which stay the same each time the
	application is run. If the ordinal differs each time then it is probably best not to mark it as
	required.</p>

	<p>When faced with an application whose elements change all the time, there are various tactics
	you can employ:</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="bold">
			When the attribute changes predictably 

			<p class="indented">For example the text on a button may change from one value to
			another according to some other variable. In this case you may
			<a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#dynamic">make the text dynamic</a> to update the
			element.</p>
		</li>

		<li class="bold">
			When the attribute changes unpredictably, but within a limited range 

			<p class="indented">For example the ordinal of an element may vary, but it is always in
			a range of 2-4 say. In this case you may decide to copy and paste the element to
			duplicate it, changing the ordinal in each copy to a new value. In your business object
			you can then use a wait stage with a <span class="emphasis">CheckExists</span> query to
			branch the flow to a different point in each case.</p>

			<p class="indented">Note that a similar effect can be achieved by making the ordinal
			<a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm#dynamic">dynamic</a>.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>See <a href="helpChoosingRequiredAttributes.htm">choosing required attributes</a> for more
	information.</p>




	<h5>My element is successfully identified at design-time, but not at run-time</h5>
	<p>This problem is likely to be because some of your attributes change during the running of
	your application.</p>

	<p>For example, if your element is a text field to which you intend to send text, you should not
	use its text as a <span class="emphasis">required</span> attribute, since its text will change
	after you write to it.</p>

	<p>This problem would manifest itself as the business object working for the first few minutes
	until the text field was written to, and failing to work thereafter.</p>
	



	
	<h5>I am having trouble detecting when an element is disabled or enabled</h5>
	<p>This may down to some confusion of terminology used in <a href="helpActiveAcessibility.htm">
	Microsoft Active Accessibility</a>. Use the <a href="attributes-aa.htm#Unavailable">Unavailable</a>
	attribute rather than the <a href="attributes.htm#Enabled">Enabled</a> attribute.</p>
	
	
	
	
	<h5>During debug Object Studio keeps bringing itself into focus. This is a problem when the target application needs to be focused</h5>
	<p>You may control the behaviour of <a href="helpObjectStudio.htm">Object Studio</a> in the
	following ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the debug buttons in the task tray (look for the Prism icon in the bottom right of your screen; use
		the context menu to choose an option). This method does not affect the focus of Object Studio.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	<h5>My Business Object works fine on one Resource PC, but not another</h5>
	<p>
		There are many possible reasons for this problem. Essentially, it is usually because
		the target application either looks or behaves differently on the second resource pc.
	</p>
	<p>
		Such differences could be down to the version of the software used on each target
		machine (you should check that the same version is installed across all resource
		PCs); or the theme in use (eg Windows XP theme versus Windows Classic theme) &mdash;
		the theme in use will very often affect the
		<a href="attributes.htm#ClassName">classnames</a> of your
		application elements; or hardware differences - eg differing screen resolution affecting
		the layout of your application.
	</p>
	<p>
		To solve this problem you will either need to make the target environment as uniform
		as possible across all Resource PCs, or <a href="helpChoosingRequiredAttributes.htm">
		choose your element attributes carefully</a> so that the same attributes can be used
		to identify in each different environment.
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that the latter solution will introduce the need for extensive testing, and will
		make the development process more cumbersome and difficult.
	</p>
	
	
	
	<h5>During debug Object Studio keeps bringing itself into focus. This is a problem when the target application needs to be focused</h5>
	<p>You may control the behaviour of <a href="helpObjectStudio.htm">Object Studio</a> in the
	following ways:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Use the debug buttons in the task tray (look for the Prism icon in the bottom right of your screen; use
		the context menu to choose an option). This method does not affect the focus of Object Studio.</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h5>My application opens all documents under one window, meaning I can't launch my own new instance, or spy it</h5>
	<p>
		Some applications, when launched, collect the required information
		(to open a new document for example), pass this information onto an 
		existing instance, and exit. One such application is Microsoft Word.
	</p>
	<p>
		The solution to this problem is to attach to the existing instance of the
		application instead. Attaching can be done at any time - beforehand or
		afterwards, but it requires the application to have been launched already.
		You will have to implement some logic to detect whether the application is
		already running, and launch/attach as appropriate in each situation.
	</p>
	
	<h5>I cannot interact with an Internet Explorer file download dialog</h5>
	<p>This problem is due to the way in which Internet Explorer is configured locally.
	You can either <a href="contact.html">contact Blue Prism</a> to discuss your Internet
	Explorer configuration or use the following workaround: use the &quot;activate&quot; action to bring the
	window into the foreground, <a href="frmStagePropertiesWait.htm">wait</a>
	five seconds and then click the desired button on the download dialog.</p>

	<h5>Javascript is not working (Access is Denied)</h5>

	<p>You may experience varied results when invoking Javascript in a web page, depending on your version and configuration
	of Internet Explorer. In particular depending on security settings, you may get an 'Access is denied' error, when trying to
	invoke Javascript methods. Your proxy server settings can affect the security restrictions imposed by Internet Explorer. 
	Where possible, you should uncheck the 'Automatically detect settings' checkbox, because this causes stricter rules to be 
	imposed.</p>
	
	<h5>Active Accessibility performance is slow</h5>

	<p>When trying to find unique active accessibility elements within a web page or complex application, performance can be slow. 
	This is due to the sheer number of elements that must be tested to find a unique match. To speed up the performance a value can
	be set for the MatchIndex attribute. What this will do is specify that Blue Prism stop searching after the specified number of 
	matches has been reached. While this does improve performance, you should be aware that usually, without this attribute set, 
	Blue Prism searches the entire object model. It is important that Blue Prism does this to ensure that the match is unique. If you
	are sure that the match will be unique, then this attribute can be used.</p>
	
	<h5>Blue Prism can't find an element in an application it attaches
		to, when intrusive techniques are being used</h5>
		
	<p>When "intrusive techniques" are enabled for an application model,
		attaching to the application may leave some controls unreachable
		or not visible in the model within Blue Prism.</p>
	<p>This happens because, with intrusive techniques enabled, Blue
		Prism listens for controls being created in the attached
		application. If the application creates its controls before Blue
		Prism is attached to it, it has no way of knowing that those
		controls exist, and can't reference them.</p>
	<p>In order to work with these controls, the application should be
		attached to before they are created, or Blue Prism should be
		used to launch the application in question, ensuring that it
		has full access to all its controls.</p>
