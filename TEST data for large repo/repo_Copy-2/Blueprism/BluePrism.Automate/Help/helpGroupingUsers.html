<p>
    A grouping mechanism is provided to allow users to be organized into 
    a hierarchical tree structure for ease of management.</p>
<p>Groups are created and managed from the user tree control on the left of 
    the <a href="helpSystemManUsers.htm">Security – Users</a>
    tab, and the context menu provides the ability to manage the groups.</p> 
    
<p>
    Users are allocated to groups through use of drag and drop.  
    Holding ctrl while carrying out this action will allow users who are 
    already a member of a group to be additionally added to the selected target group.
</p>

<p>
    Users can be removed from groups from the context menu, likewise groups can also 
    be deleted in the same way.
