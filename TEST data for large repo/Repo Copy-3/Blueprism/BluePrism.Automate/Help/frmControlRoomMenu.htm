    current status assessed. There are three entry points to the control room, accessed via the
    side bar, application main menu or top menu.</p>

    inexperienced users.</p>

    <h3><a href="frmStopProcess.htm">Stop a Process</a></h3>

    inexperienced users.</p>

    <p>Manage the Blue Prism run-time environment by starting and stopping multiple processes across
    multiple resources. The Control Room features a drag and drop user interface which allows
    experienced users to quickly define an environment and start processes running without
    requiring repetitive configuration.</p>

    <p>More in-depth features such as logging levels and fault finding can also be determined
    within the Control Room.</p>
