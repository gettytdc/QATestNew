    CHOOSING A TOPIC NUMBER - in practice

    1) Skip through this file looking for the appropriate section (eg Control Room).
    2) Observe the last topic number and increment it.
    3) You may wish to leave an interval of 10 (or so) between topics to allow new ones
            to slip in between - the choice is yours.
            



    CHOOSING A TOPIC NUMBER - the theory.

    1) Choose a section number for your help topic as follows:
		a) Begin with zero.
		b) For Process studio errors, add 1;
		c) For Object studio errors, add 2;
		d) For Control Room errors, add 4;
		e) For System Manager errors, add 8,
		f) For Report Console errors, add 16,
		g) For AMI errors, add 32.
		h) (Unassigned 64)
		h) (Unassigned 128)
		i) (Unassigned 256)
		j) For a general error, add 512.
    2) Multiply the above by 1024.
    3) Choose a topic number within your chosen section (eg 37) and add it to your last number.

    <h3>List of Help Topics by Number</h3>

<!-- Process Studio errors -->

   <h5 class="bold">Topic 1034 - Failed to read/change backup interval. <a name="Topic1034" id="Topic1034"></a></h5>
    <p>This means that Blue Prism had a problem communicating with the database. For general
    information on backups see the <a href="helpAutosave.htm">Autosave help</a>.</p>
    <p>For general help on database errors see <a href="helpDatabase.htm">database
    help</a>.</p>



    <h5 class="bold">Topic 1044 - Failed to read/store user preference for edit summaries<a name="Topic1044" id="Topic1044"></a> </h5>
    <p>This means that Blue Prism had a problem communicating with the database. For general
    information see the <a href="frmProcessComparison.htm">Process Comparison help</a>.</p>
    <p>For general help on database errors see <a href="helpDatabase.htm">database
    help</a>.</p>

    
    
    <h5 class="bold">Topic 1054 - Notification of need to reset process before start parameters can
    take effect<a name="Topic1054" id="Topic1054"></a> </h5>
    <p>Any start parameters defined are applied when a process is first run. Thus if you are in the
    middle of debugging a process when you change your start parameters, your changes will have no
    effect until you restart the process.</p>
    <p>For general help see <a href="frmStartParams.htm">start parameters</a>.</p>
 
 
 <h5 class="bold">Topic 1064 - Warnings against the use of DateDiff function<a name="Topic1064" id="Topic1064"></a> </h5>
    <p>The datediff function should be avoided where possible, because Blue Prism provides superior methods for
    achieving similar goals. In particular, it should not be used for detecting the time of day, because the
    result given will vary according to daylight-saving changes to the time. The preferred method of achieving
    this goal is to compare the difference in the current time to a known time in order to obtain a timespan;
    this timespan should then be compared to a fixed value.
    </p>
    <p>
    For example the expression
    </p>
    <pre>DateDiff(6, Today(), Now()) &lt; (18*60)</pre>
    <p>
    is intended to determine whether the current time is before 6pm. The preferred method is as follows
    </p>
    <pre>LocalTime() - [MyReferenceTime] &lt; [MyTimespan]</pre>
    <p>
    where the data item 'MyReferenceTime' represents the moment in time of 6pm this evening, and the data item
    'MyTimespan' stores a timespan of value zero.
    </p>
<!-- Object Studio errors -->

    

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 2058 - Publication of Init and Cleanup pages<a name="Topic2058" id="Topic2058"></a> </h5>

    <p>These pages must be published. For general information see
    <a href="helpInitAndCleanup.htm">Init and cleanup pages</a>.</p> 

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 2068 - Process or Business Object imported is invalid<a name="Topic2068"
    id="Topic2068"></a></h5>

    <p>These means that either the file is corrupt on disk, or that the xml representing the
    process/business object is invalid. This may occur if a user edits the xml by hand.</p>
    
<!--Control Room errors -->

    

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 4106 - Communications error<a name="Topic4106" id="Topic4106"></a> </h5>

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 4116 - Failed to start session<a name="Topic4116"
    id="Topic4116"></a> </h5>

    <p>This may indicate a <a href="Topic4106">communications error</a>, or could be a problem with
    the status of the remote <a href="helpResources.htm">resource</a>.</p>

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 4126 - Failed to set start parameters for session<a name="Topic4126"
    id="Topic4126"></a> </h5>

    <p>This may indicate a <a href="Topic4106">communications error</a>, or could be a problem with
    the status of the remote <a href="helpResources.htm">resource</a>.</p>
 
<!--System Manager errors -->

	<h5 class="bold">Topic 8202 - Maximum number of system user roles reached <a name="Topic8202" id="Topic8202"></a> </h5>

    <p>Blue Prism allows you to create up to 64 different roles. It will not allow you to create any
    more than this number. See <a href="helpUserPermissions.htm">user permissions</a>. for general
    help on user roles and permissions.</p>

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 8212 - Invalid user name entered<a name="Topic8212" id="Topic8212"></a> </h5>

    <p>User names must not be blank and they must not exceed 20 characters in length. See
    <a href="frmUserSettings.htm">user settings</a> help for general information.</p>
    
<!-- AMI errors -->
    

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 32778 - Failure to launch target application<a name="Topic32778" id="Topic32778"></a> </h5>

    <p>This could be for a number of reasons including:</p>

    <ul class="indented">
        <li>The target application is already launched.</li>

        <li>The executable of the target application could not be found.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 32788 - Unrecognised application type<a name="Topic32788" id="Topic32788"></a> </h5>

    <p>Your version of Application Manager does not support the type of application specified in
    your process. You may either re-run the application definition wizard to select a new
    application type, or you may request an updated version of Application Manager from Blue Prism
    which supports the application type in question.</p>

    <p>To discover the application type currently selected, export your process to a local xml
    file, and look for the xml element "ApplicationTypeInfo".</p><!-- AMI errors -->
    

    <h5 class="bold">Topic 32798 - Application not connected<a name="Topic32798" id="Topic32798"></a> </h5>

    <p>You cannot interact with your target application until it is launched. Make sure that your
    business object is configured such that your application is always launched before any
    interaction takes place.</p>
    
           
    <h5 class="bold">Topic 32808 - Failure of Read/Write/Navigate against Java Runtime Environment version 1.3.x<a name="Topic32808" id="Topic32808"></a> </h5>

    <p>Blue Prism's <a href="helpJavaAutomation.htm">Java Automation</a> makes use of 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/accessbridge/">Sun's Java Access Bridge</a> to
    interact with the target application. A known limitation with Sun's product is that support for version
    1.3 of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is incomplete and error-prone. See also the
	<a href="troubleshooting-jab.html#TextBoxJRE13">Java Access Bridge Troubleshooting</a>
	page.
    </p>
      
    <h5 class="bold">Topic 32818 - Target application information not set<a name="Topic32818" id="Topic32818"></a> </h5>

    <p>Before interacting with a target application, some information about that application must be registered.
    Please visit the <a href="frmIntegrationAssistant.htm">Application Modeller</a> to fill out this information,
    then save your business object.</p>
    
    
<!-- General errors -->


    <h5 class="bold">Topic 1048586 - Insufficient permissions to perform an action<a name="Topic1048586" id="Topic1048586"></a> </h5>

    <p>See <a href="helpUserPermissions.htm">user permissions</a>.</p>
        
    
    <h5 class="bold">Topic 524 298 - Operation denied due to licensing restrictions<a name="Topic524298" id="Topic524298"></a> </h5>

    <p>
		This means that the current <a href="licence.html">license</a> installed in
		<a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a> does not permit the requested
		action.
    </p>
    <p>
		Note that if you recently changed your license, then you will need to log out of Blue Prism
		and log back in again (on each <a href="helpResourcePCs.htm">machine</a>) for the
		change to take full effect.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you believe there to be an error, then please <a href="contact.html">contact Blue Prism</a>
