    <h3>Autosave</h3>

    <p>Whilst working in <a href="frmProcess.htm">Process Studio</a>, Blue Prism can automatically
    make a backup of your work to guard against system crashes, power failures and other unforeseen
    failures. Such backups will not overwrite your existing process but will be recorded in a
    separate location on the Blue Prism database, giving you the choice to revert to the unchanged
    process, or to overwrite the existing process with the version contained in the backup.</p>

    <h3>Customising the backup interval</h3>

    <p>The default backup interval can be set in <a href="helpSystemManagerSettings.htm">system manager</a>. 
	However each user can override the default setting by adjusting the backup interval via the file menu in 
	Process Studio. This setting will be remembered by Blue Prism for each user across different visits to 
	Process Studio on different machines.</p>

    <h3>Backing up</h3>

    <p>Backups will take place in the background without the user noticing. Blue Prism will notify
    the user discretely at the moment a backup is made by displaying a message on the status bar in
    Process Studio.</p>

    <h3>Recovering from a backup</h3>

    <p>In the event of a system failure Blue Prism will not allow any further edits to any process
    affected. One of two things must happen in order for work to continue on a process. Either the
    original version of the process must be restored or the latest backup must be restored. If
    after one version of the process has been restored it is then decided that it would be better
    to restore another version instead, this may be performed with ease - all that is required is
    to restore the desired version in the same way that the current one was restored. The user may
    choose between different versions as many times as is desired before committing to a particular
    version. When the user is ready to commit to a particular version they should click the
    save button in process studio. At this point all existing backups will be cleared and there
    will be no further opportunity to go back.</p>

    <p>Restorations are made via system manager. See the help page for the
    <a href="frmProcessRecover.htm">backup recovery wizard</a> for further details.</p>
