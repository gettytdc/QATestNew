    <h3>Connections Dialog</h3>

    <p>The connections dialog allows you to store different database connection configurations.
	All connections require a name, and depending on the connection type other information is required.</p>
	
	<h3>Connection Type</h3>
    <p>From the dropdown you can choose between five connection types:
		<ul>
		<li>Blue Prism Server</li>
		<li>SQL Server (SQL Authentication)</li>
		<li>SQL Server (Windows Authentication)</li>
		<li>Availability Group (SQL Authentication)</li>
		<li>Availability Group (Windows Authentication)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	
	<h3 id="bpserver">Blue Prism Server</h3>
	<p>Connection to a dedicated Blue Prism Server is the most secure connection configuration.<p>
	
	<p>See the <a href="helpBPServer.htm#configuring">Blue Prism Server</a>
	page for details on how to configure and run a server.</p>
	
	<h4>Server Name</h4>
	<p>You must supply the hostname of the machine on which your Blue Prism Server is running. The
    local machine must be able to resolve the supplied hostname.</p>
	
    <h4>Connection Mode</h4>
    <p>
        This allows you to select the connection mode that is used for connections between
        the client and the Blue Prism server. Note that this setting must
        match the <a href="helpBPServer.htm#connection-mode">corresponding value</a>
        set in the Blue Prism Server configuration.
    </p>
	
    <h4>Port</h4>
	<p>You must supply the port on which your Blue Prism Server is listening.</p>

	<h4>Callback Port</h4>
	<p>Specifies a port that the client will listen on for callbacks from the server. This can
	be left set to 0 to allow an available port to be chosen automatically. Note that if you
	use this option to force a specific port, only one instance of any Blue Prism application
	will be able to connect to the server from that machine. This setting is only
    applicable to Blue Prism Server connection using a .NET Remoting connection mode.</p>
    	
    <h3 id="sql-sqlauth">SQL Server (SQL Authentication)</h3>
	<p>SQL Authentication uses credentials of an SQL user to access the database.</p>
    <p>Contained databases are supported in Blue Prism but must be created manually using the script generated by the /getdbscript option in AutomateC.</p>
	
	<h4>Server Name</h4>
    <p>You must supply the hostname of the machine on which your database server is hosted. The
    local machine must be able to resolve the supplied hostname.</p>

    <h4>Database Name</h4>
    <p>The name of your Blue Prism database at it appears on the database server. If no such database
    exists yet then you may choose a database name here. You may then create a database via the
    Blue Prism user interface as described on the <a href="frmCreateDatabase.htm">Create
    Database</a> help page.</p>

    <h4>Database User ID</h4>
    <p>Supply here the username of the database user that Blue Prism should use when accessing the
    database.</p>

    <h4>Database User Password</h4>
    <p>Supply here the password of the user named in the field above. This password will never be
    revealed by Blue Prism.</p>

    <h4>Additional SQL Connection Parameters (non-BP Server only)</h4>
    <p>Any further semicolon-separated parameters which should be appended
    to the query string created to access the database. <i>eg.</i>
    <code>Encrypt=true;TrustServerCertificate=true</code>.</p>
	
	<h3 id="sql-winauth">SQL Server (Windows Authentication)</h3>
	<p>Windows Authentication uses the currently logged on windows user credentials to access the database.
	Access must be granted on the database server to allow the Windows user to access the database.</p>
	
	<h4>Server Name</h4>
    <p>You must supply the hostname of the machine on which your database server is hosted. The
    local machine must be able to resolve the supplied hostname.</p>

    <h4>Database Name</h4>
    <p>The name of your Blue Prism database at it appears on the database server. If no such database
    exists yet then you may choose a database name here. You may then create a database via the
    Blue Prism user interface as described on the <a href="frmCreateDatabase.htm">Create
    Database</a> help page.</p>

    <h3 id="sql-sqlauth">Availability Group</h3>
	<p>The two Availability Group options are the same as the corresponding SQL Server
	options, but connect to a SQL Server Availability group. The Server Name refers to
	the Availibity Group Listener, and two extra settings are available:</p>

	<h4>Port</h4>
    	<p>The port the Availability Group Listener is listening on.</p>

	<h4>Multi Subnet Failover</h4>
    	<p>Allows multi subnet failover to be enabled on the connection. Refer to Microsoft's
	documentation on this for more information.</p>

    <h3>Using Multiple Connections</h3>

    <p>You may wish to store more than one connection - for example one database for testing and
    another for live. This dialog allows you to move quickly from one connection to another. New
    connections are added using the "New Connection" button. The details of the new connection are
    then filled out on the right hand side.</p>

    <p>To edit an existing connection, simply select it from the list on the left and fill out the
    details on the right. Whichever connection is selected when the "OK" button is pressed will be
    the active connection used by Blue Prism.</p>

    <p>For security purposes, only the password of the current connection is stored, so you will
    have to retype the password when you switch from one connection to another.</p>
