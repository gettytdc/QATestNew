    <h3>Using the logs viewer</h3>

    <p>The logs viewer provides many features useful for reading and searching session logs.</p>

    <p>By default the last page of the log is shown, enabling the user to determine from the last
    line of the log the circumstances in which the process exited (be they normal or abnormal). The
    user may navigate to other pages using the arrow buttons at the bottom of the form: the double
    arrowed buttons will skip to the earliest/latest page and the single arrowed buttons will
    navigate to the previous/next page.</p>

    <p>To view larger or smaller pages, adjust the value in the bottom right controlling the number
    of rows per page. Please be aware that the larger the page size, the longer it will take to
    fetch each page from the database: depending on the size of your log and the performance of
    your database server, this could take some time.</p>

    <h3>Viewing Stage IDs</h3>

    <p>The facility to view or hide stage IDs from the log is available via the checkbox in the
    upper portion of the form. Stage IDs are Blue Prism's way of identifying stages in a process
    diagram, rather than by name. By displaying stage IDs, an advanced user may check for internal
    inconsistencies in a process. However, few users will find this information useful. You may
    safely ignore this feature if you do not understand it.</p>

    <h3>Searching the logs</h3>

    <p>The user may search for text in on the current page by entering a search term in the combo
    box at the top of the form and clicking on the 'find' button. Each instance of the search term
    will be highlighted in turn. You may instantly see all instances by clicking the 'highlight'
    button, which will highlight each instance with the current colour. You may subsequently change
    the colour and arrange for another search term to be highlighted simultaneously. The 'clear'
    button will clear all highlights.</p>

    <p>Text is only searched for on the current page. However when the end of the page is reached
    Blue Prism will prompt the user to search the next page. At this point the user may also choose
    to search the entire log - in this case, Blue Prism will automatically fetch each page in turn,
    search the page and pause on the next instance of the search term or fetch the next page again
    if no instance is found. Once Blue Prism has searched all pages in this manner it will inform the
    user via a popup dialog. Please be aware that searching all pages may take some time.</p>

    <p>Users familiar with wildcards and regular expressions may use them by placing a checkmark in
    the appropriate box and choosing the appropriate option. Please see the pages on
    <a href="helpWildcardsAndRegex.htm">wildcards and regular
    expressions</a> for further information.</p>

    <h3>Exporting Logs</h3>

    <p>Should you have a need to use the log in a context outside of Blue Prism you may export the
    log to a flat file suitable for sending via email or copying to a portable storage medium.
    Three file formats are available: plain text file (as you see on the log viewer itself); html
    file (suitable for markup in a web browser); and csv file (standing for comma separated values,
    this file format is designed for formatting tabular data making it suitable for use in a
    spreadsheet). If you choose either html or csv, the data in each row of the log will be
    separated into distinct columns of message datetime, message and stageid (where
    appropriate).</p>

    <p>To export a log (or a section of a log), choose the appropriate export option from the file
    menu at the top left of the form. A pop wizard-like dialog will appear, which will guide you
    through the necessary steps. See the help file for the <a href="frmLogExport.htm">Log Export
    Wizard</a> for further information.</p>
