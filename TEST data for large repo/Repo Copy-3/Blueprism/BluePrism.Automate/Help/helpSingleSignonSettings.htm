	<h2>Domain</h2>
	<p>You should enter the domain where the Blue Prism Security Groups will reside.
    You must enter the fully qualified domain name (e.g.
    &quot;global.MyDomain.local&quot;).</p>

	<h2>Verify Connection</h2>
	<p>This button can be used to validate that Blue Prism can connect to a domain using the name provided from the current device.</p>

	<h2>Administrators Group</h2>
	<p>When configuring single sign-on for Blue Prism it is necessary to select an Active Directory security group whose members will be granted access to all areas of Blue Prism.
	The configuration of single sign-on for Blue Prism should be undertaken as a user who belongs to this security group.</p>
    <p>
        Once the database is created and configured for single sign-on, a Blue Prism administrator should sign in to Blue Prism and configure the required Blue Prism security roles.
        Once these have been defined, each should be associated with an Active Directory security group which can be managed using the <a href="frmManageRoles.htm">Manage Roles</a> dialog.
    </p>

	<h2>Trouble Shooting</h2>
