	<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
	
	<p>Blue Prism contains a mechanism by which components making up the
	configuration of Blue Prism can be transferred between different
	Blue Prism environments</p>
	
	<p>The <code>Release Manager</code> allows bundles of components
	to be defined as a 'package'. The created package can then be
	exported into a file as a 'release'.</p>
	
	<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>
	
	<p>A package provides a mechanism for collecting a list of elements
	which should make up a release. It is created within the <a
	href="relman-ui.html">Release Manager</a> in the Blue Prism client.
	</p>
	
	<p>A package consists of a name and description, and its contents.
	The contents of a package can be made up of any or all of the
	following components :-</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Processes</li>
		<li>Visual Business Objects</li>
		<li>Web Service Definitions</li>
		<li>Process Groups</li>
		<li>Environment Variables</li>
		<li>Credentials</li>
		<li>Work Queues</li>
		<li>Schedules</li>
		<li>Fonts</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Once a package has been created, you can create a <a
	href="#releases">release</a> from it.</p>
	
	<p>Packages can be modified or deleted from within Release Manager.
	</p>
	
	<p>If a package contains a component which is deleted, the reference
	to that component is removed from the release</p>
	
	<h3 id="releases">Releases</h3>
	
	<p>A release represents a package at a particular point in time -
	in more practical terms, a release is a file with all the contents
	of a package saved into it.</p>
	
	<p>It is made up of a name, some release notes, and the detailed
	contents of the packages - ie. where the package contains the list
	of components, the release contains the components' data.</p>
	
	<h4 id="create-release">Creating</h4>
	
	<p>When a release is created, the file is saved to the hard drive,
	and an entry is saved to the database containing details about the
	release, such as its name, release notes, user, date/time created
	and its contents at the time that the release was created.
	Note that if the package contents change or if components within
	the package are deleted, the release's contents on the system remain
	the same.</p>
	
	<p>A release is saved to a file, usually with a
	<code>.bprelease</code> extension. This can then be imported into
	another Blue Prism 4.1+ environment. When a release is imported into
	an environment, an entry is recorded on the database for that
	release too. This records similar details to the above releases,
	except that instead of the creating user and date/time created, the
	details will include the importing user and date/time imported.</p>
	
	<h4 id="import-release">Importing</h4>
	
	<p>A release can be imported from within Release Manager, or by
	choosing <code>Import</code> from the <code>File</code> menu within
	the Blue Prism client.</p>
	
	<p>The different components use different rules to determine how
	they should react to conflicts in the target system - most
	components require some form of user input to indicate the action
	that should be taken if such a conflict should occur.</p>
	
	<h5 id="import-rules">Import Rules</h5>
	<p>The rules defining how each supported component is handled are
	given below:-</p>
	
	<dl class="listplease import-rules">
		<dt>Processes</dt>
		<dd><ul>
			
			<li>If the target environment does not contain a process/VBO
			with the same ID or name as the incoming process, it is
			imported without any further user intervention.</li>
			
			<li>If the target environment contains a process/VBO with
			the same ID as the incoming process, the user is prompted
			to either :-
			<ul>
				<li>Overwrite the existing process (Default) -or-</li>
				<li>Save the process with a new ID.</li>
			</ul>
			If the latter is chosen and the existing process/VBO has the
			same name as the incoming process, the user is prompted for
			a new name for the incoming process.</li>
			
			<li>If the target environment contains a process/VBO with
			the same name as the incoming process, the user is prompted
			to either :-
			<ul>
				<li>Rename the incoming process (Default) -or-</li>
				<li>Overwrite the existing process/VBO -or-</li>
				<li>Rename the existing process.</li>
			</ul>
			If a rename is chosen, the user is prompted for a new name
			to rename the process / VBO to.</li>
		</ul></dd>
			
		<dt>Visual Business Objects</dt>
		<dd><ul><li>VBOs are handled identically to processes.</li></ul>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Web Service Definitions</dt>
		<dd><ul>
			<li>If the target environment does not contain a web service
			with the same name as the incoming service, it is imported
			without any further user intervention.</li>
			
			<li>If the target environment contains a web service with
			the same name as the incoming service, the user is prompted
			to either :-
			<ul>
				<li>Overwrite the existing web service (Default)</li>
				<li>Choose a new name for the incoming web service</li>
				<li>Choose a new name for the existing web service</li>
			</ul>
			If a rename is chosen, the user is prompted for a new name
			for the web service in question.</li>
		</ul></dd>
		
		<dt>Process Groups</dt>
		<dd><ul>
			<li>Incoming process groups are merged with existing process
			groups with the same name in the target environment. If the
			incoming group contains processes being imported which are
			not part of the existing group, they are added once the
			incoming processes have been imported.</li>
		</ul></dd>
		
		<dt>Environment Variables</dt>
		<dd><ul>
			<li>If no environment variable exists in the target system
			with the same name, the variable and its value in the source
			environment at the time of creating the release are set in
			the target environment.</li>
			<li>If an environment variable is found in the target
			environment with the same name, it is updated with the
			incoming description and datatype. If the existing value
			cannot be converted to the incoming data type, the incoming
			value is set in the target environment, otherwise the
			current value is retained.</li>
		</ul></dd>
		
		<dt>Credentials</dt>
		<dd><ul>
			<li>If no credential exists in the target environment with
			the same name, the user is prompted for a username and
			password to set in the credential, and it is created.</li>
			<li><p>If a credential already exists in the target
			environment with the same name, the incoming credential is
			merged with it, such that the incoming description is set in
			the existing credential, and any incoming processes
			associated with the credential are associated on the target
			system.</p>
			<p>The existing username and password are not affected by
			importing an identically named credential.</p></li>
			<li>Regardless of the existence or otherwise of the
			credential, the user has the option of not importing the
			credential as part of the import process.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Note: </strong> The default encryption scheme must be
			in place on the target environment before any credentials
			can be imported, otherwise an error will occur and the
			import operation will fail.</p>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Work Queues</dt>
		<dd><ul>
			<li>If no work queue with the same name exists in the target
			environment, one is created with the incoming details.</li>
			<li>If a work queue with the same name exists in the target
			environment, its details (key field and max attempts) are
			overwritten by the incoming queue. Any items in the queue
			will be unaffected by these changes.</li>
		</ul></dd>
		
		<dt>Schedules</dt>
		<dd><ul>
			<li>If no schedule exists with the same name as the imported
			schedule, it is created, with no scheduled sessions, in the
			target environment.</li>
			<li>If a schedule with the same name exists within the
			target environment, its description, timing data and task
			structure is overwritten with the incoming schedule
			definition. Note that :-<ul>
				<li>Note that if there exist any tasks with the same
				name as those being imported with the schedule, their
				descriptions and their "On Success" and "On Exception"
				settings are overwritten, but the list of scheduled
				sessions will be retained.</li>
				<li>Also note that if the existing schedule is 'retired'
				it will not be rejuvenated by importing a schedule over
				the top of it, although its data will change - it will
				have to be 'unretired' manually if required.</li>
			</ul></li>
		</ul></dd>
		
		<dt>Calendars</dt>
		<dd>Although calendars can't be explicitly added to a package,
		if a schedule requires a calendar to function, it is included
		along with the schedule in any generated release.
		<ul>
			<li>If no calendar with the same name exists within the
			target environment, it is created there</li>
			<li>If a calendar with the same name exists within the
			target environment, it is overwritten with the incoming
			calendar data.</li>
		</ul>
		</dd>
		
		<dt>Fonts</dt>
		<dd><ul>
			<li>If no font with the same name exists on the target
			system, it is created with the incoming details.</li>
			<li>If a font with the same name exists, it is overwritten
			with the incoming font.</li>
		</ul></dd>
	</dl>
	
	<h4 id="verify-release">Verifying</h4>
	
	<p>There exists a mechanism with which a release can be verified
	against the environment from which it came - this checks to see if
	there have been any changes in the environment since the release
	was created.</p>
	
	<h3 id="legacy">Legacy Import/Export</h3>
	
	<p>Before the release manager, Blue Prism supported the import and
	export of single processes or visual business objects. Files created
	from these earlier versions of Blue Prism can still be imported
	using the same mechanism as importing a release - just change the
	file filter in the <code>File Open</code> dialog to look for
	<code>*.xml</code> files rather than <code>*.bprelease</code> files.
	</p>
	
	<p>If you need to export a process / visual business object with a
	view to importing it in an older version of Blue Prism, you can
	still do so by opening the process / object in Process Studio /
	Object Studio and choosing <code>File | Export | This Process</code>
	or <code>File | Export | This Page</code> to export the process or
	the page as before.</p>
