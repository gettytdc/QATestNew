    <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
    <p>Timetables provide a view of a filtered list of schedules and their calculated execution
    times within a specified date range.</p>
    <p>When a timetable is selected in the schedule manager tree, it is displayed in the right-hand
    pane of the Blue Prism client.</p>
    <p>From here, the parameters of the timetable can be set - which schedules to look for, the
    date range to view, and the timetable data itself can be viewed.</p>
    <p>A default timetable is created when Blue Prism is installed called 'Today &amp; Tomorrow'.
    This will present a list of all schedules which have activation times falling on today's or
    tomorrow's date.</p>

    <h3 id="create-timetable">Creating a timetable</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-newtimetable.png" alt="Creating a timetable"/>
    </div>
    <p>A timetable is created by right-clicking the 'Timetables' element of the schedule manager
    tree and selecting 'New Timetable'.</p>
    <p>A new timetable will be created and populated with default values. Note that the actual
    timetable data will not be populated until the timetable is 'refreshed' which implicitly saves
    the	timetable to the database.</p>

    <h3 id="configure-timetable">Configuring a timetable</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-timetable-date.png" alt="Setting a relative date"/>
    </div>
    <h4 id="set-date">Setting the date range</h4>
    <p>You can set the timetable to show an arbitrary number of days of executed schedules,
    starting on a specified day.</p>
    <div class="captioned-image screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-timetable-fixed-date.png" alt="Setting a fixed date"/>
    </div>
    <p>The specified end day can be set to 'Today' or 'Tomorrow' - this will use the current
    date or the next date whenever the timetable is run. This is enabled by checking the radio
    button next to the Today/Tomorrow dropdown.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, it can be set to a fixed date by checking the radio button next to the
    date picker and choosing the date to use from there.</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-report-schedules.png" alt="Selecting the schedules"/>
    </div>
    <h4 id="select-schedules">Selecting the schedules</h4>
    <p>The timetable can list any or all active or expired schedules. Note that expired schedules
    will not appear in the actual timetable data unless a date in the past is specified.</p>
    <p>A schedule is included in the timetable when the adjacent checkbox in the list is ticked.</p>
    <p>A timetable will dynamically include all schedules if the 'All Schedules' checkbox is ticked.
    Note that this differs from ticking each schedule individually in that a timetable will
    automatically include any new schedules if 'All Schedules' is ticked, whereas it would require
    the checkbox to be manually ticked otherwise.</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <h3 id="view-timetable">Viewing the timetable</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-timetable-run.png" alt="Running the timetable"/>
    </div>
    <p>The timetable is run when thetimetable is first selected in the schedule manager tree and
    when the timetable is saved.</p>
    <p>It can be run manually by clicking the 'Refresh' button - this implicitly saves the timetable
    to the database.</p>
    <p>The timetable itself consists of a list of schedule activations which are configured to occur
    within the specified date range. It will show the schedule name and the time at which the
    schedule is configured to execute, as well as providing a link to the schedule that the
    timetable entry refers to.</p>
    <p>The relevant <a href="helpSchedulesUI.htm">schedule</a> is selected in the schedule manager
    tree when 'View Schedule' is clicked.</p>

    <h3 id="export-timetable">Exporting the timetable</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-timetable-export.png" alt="Exporting the timetable"/>
    </div>
    <p>The timetable can be exported to a file by clicking on the 'Export' button while it is open.</p>
    <p>The export wizard accepts the file to export the log to, and the format of the exported
       data, either 'text' (human readable format) or 'csv' (comma-separated-variable format,
       typically more suitable for viewing within Excel or such like).</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <h3 id="save-timetable">Saving a timetable</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-timetable-save.png" alt="Saving the timetable"/>
    </div>
    <p>A timetable can be saved by right-clicking it in the schedule manager and selecting 'Save'.
    </p>
    <p>Alternatively, by clicking on the 'Apply Changes' button, all changed schedules, reports
    and timetables will be saved.</p>
    <p>Finally, a timetable is implicitly saved when it is refreshed by clicking on the 'Refresh'
    button.</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <h3 id="delete-timetable">Deleting a timetable</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-timetable-delete.png" alt="Deleting the timetable"/>
    </div>
    <p>A timetable can be deleted by right-clicking it in the schedule manager and selecting
    'Delete'.</p>
