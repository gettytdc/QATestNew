	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Blue Prism allows you to view the Active Directory groups to which a user belongs,
	as part of a  <a href="helpSingleSignon.htm">Single Sign-on</a> configuration. This may
	prove to be a useful diagnostic tool in the event that a specific user has trouble accessing
	Blue Prism - you may check that they have the appropriate group memberships, as 
	<a href="frmManageRoles.htm">mapped against Blue Prism user roles</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Usage</h3>
	<p>This feature is accessed via the <a href="helpSystemManUsers.htm">&quot;Users&quot; section</a>
	in <a href="frmSystemManager.htm">System Manager</a>, and is only available when your current
	database is configured for <a href="helpSingleSignon.htm">Single Sign-on</a>.</p>
	<p>Select the user of interest, and click &quot;View User's Group Membership&quot; from the right
	hand side, which will open a form containing two grids. The first grid shows all Blue Prism user roles, the
    <a href="frmManageRoles.htm">Active Directory group each role is mapped to</a> and whether the user 
    is a member of that group. The second shows all Active Directory security groups that the user 
    is a member of with a description underneath of where the Active Directory query was perfomed.
