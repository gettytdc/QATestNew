        <p>Schedule Report</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>Reports provide a view of a filtered list of active schedules which have been executed
    within a specified date range.</p>
    <p>When a report is selected in the schedule manager tree, it is displayed in the right-hand
    pane of the Blue Prism client.</p>
    <p>From here, the parameters of the report can be set - which schedules to report on, the
    date range to view, and the report itself can be viewed.</p>
    <p>A default report is created when Blue Prism is installed called 'Recent Activity'. This
    will present a list of all schedules which have executed either yesterday or today.</p>
    <p>Note that if a schedule is retired or deleted, it will not show up in any reports.</p>

    <h3 id="create-report">Creating a report</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-newreport.png" alt="Creating a report"/>
    </div>
    <p>A report is created by right-clicking the 'Reports' element of the schedule manager tree
    and selecting 'New Report'.</p>
    <p>A new report will be created and populated with default values. Note that the actual report
    data will not be populated until the report is 'refreshed' which implicitly saves the report to
    the	database.</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <h3 id="configure-report">Configuring a report</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-report-date.png" alt="Setting a relative date"/>
    </div>
    <h4 id="set-date">Setting the date range</h4>
    <p>You can set the report to show an arbitrary number of days of executed schedules, ending
    on a specified day.</p>
    <div class="captioned-image screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-report-fixed-date.png" alt="Setting a fixed date"/>
    </div>
    <p>The specified end day can be set to 'Today' or 'Yesterday' - this will use the current
    date or the previous date whenever the report is run. This is enabled by checking the radio
    button next to the Today/Yesterday dropdown.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, it can be set to a fixed date by checking the radio button next to the
    date picker and choosing the date to use from there.</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-report-schedules.png" alt="Selecting the schedules"/>
    </div>
    <h4 id="select-schedules">Selecting the schedules</h4>
    <p>The report can list any or all active or expired schedules.</p>
    <p>A schedule is included in the report when the adjacent checkbox in the list is ticked.</p>
    <p>A report will dynamically include all schedules if the 'All Schedules' checkbox is ticked.
    Note that this differs from ticking each schedule individually in that a report will
    automatically include any new schedules if 'All Schedules' is ticked, whereas it would require
    the checkbox to be manually ticked otherwise.</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <h3 id="view-report">Viewing the report</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-report-run.png" alt="Running the report"/>
    </div>
    <p>The report is run when the report is first selected in the schedule manager tree and when
    the report is saved.</p>
    <p>It can be run manually by clicking the 'Refresh' button - this implicitly saves the report
    to the database.</p>
    <p>The report itself consists of a list of schedule activations which occurred within the
    specified date range. It will show the schedule name, the time at which the schedule was
    executed, the time at which it finished (or blank if no end time is recorded, typically if
    it is still running), the hostname and port of the server instance which ran the schedule
    and links to the schedule log and the schedule itself.</p>
    <p>The <a href="helpScheduleLog.htm">schedule log</a> for that instance is opened when the
    'View Log' link	is clicked.</p>
    <p>The relevant <a href="helpSchedulesUI.htm">schedule</a> is selected in the schedule manager
    tree when 'View Schedule' is clicked.</p>

    <h3 id="export-report">Exporting the report</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-report-export.png" alt="Exporting the report"/>
    </div>
    <p>The report can be exported to a file by clicking on the 'Export' button while it is open.</p>
    <p>The export wizard accepts the file to export the log to, and the format of the exported
       data, either 'text' (human readable format) or 'csv' (comma-separated-variable format,
       typically more suitable for viewing within Excel or such like).</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <h3 id="save-report">Saving a report</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-report-save.png" alt="Saving the report"/>
    </div>
    <p>A report can be saved by right-clicking it in the schedule manager and selecting 'Save'.</p>
    <p>Alternatively, by clicking on the 'Apply Changes' button, all changed schedules, reports
    and timetables will be saved.</p>
    <p>Finally, a report is implicitly saved when it is refreshed by clicking on the 'Refresh'
    button.</p>
    <div class="clearer"></div>

    <h3 id="delete-report">Deleting a report</h3>
    <div class="captioned-image section-screenshot">
        <img src="Graphics/schedule-report-delete.png" alt="Deleting the report"/>
    </div>
    <p>A report can be deleted by right-clicking it in the schedule manager and selecting 'Delete'.
