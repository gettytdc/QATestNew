    <h3>Loop Start Stage</h3>

    <p>Loops are used in Blue Prism to sequentially access the contents of a collection. Typical
    scenarios include extracting customer data one by one and calculating total debts of multiple
    accounts by summing them one by one.</p>

    <p>Data in a collection need not be accessed sequentially; if only a small number of items in
    the collection are desired at a time then each item in the collection may be referenced by
    name. See the help page on <a href="helpCollections.htm">collections</a> for an overview.</p>

    <h3>Completing the Properties Form</h3>

    <p>The loop start stage properties dialog has a number of fields to allow you to define what
    happens at the start of the loop. What happens during the loop will be determined by the
    business objects, the calculations etc that you place between the loop start and the loop
    end.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Enter a name</h3>

        <p>The name that you enter identifies the loop start, it will be displayed on the process
        diagram.</p>

        <h3>2. Enter a description</h3>

        <p>The additional description field allows a lengthier narrative to be entered.</p>

        <h3>3. Select Collection</h3>

        <p>The collection drop down allows you to select a collection that will be used as the
        basis for the loop.</p>
