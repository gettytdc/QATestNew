	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Blue Prism requires a user to provide authentication before they
		are able to perform any tasks within the environment defined in
		the currently configured connection.</p>
	
	<p>There are two methods of authentication supported by Blue Prism,
		namely 'Blue Prism user authentication' and 'Active Directory
		authentication' (or 'single sign on'). The type of
		authentication to be used is set when the Blue Prism database is
		created and cannot be changed on existing databases.</p>
		
	<p>This login screen provides the interface with which a user can
		authenticate to the product and enter Blue Prism.</p>

	<h3>Blue Prism authentication</h3>
	<p>This requires each user to have a corresponding user configured
		in System Manager. In order to enter the product, the user must
		enter their user name and password and click the
		<code>Sign In</code> button.</p>
	
	<p>For further details on maintaining users within a Blue Prism
		environment see the <a href="helpSystemManUsers.htm">System
		Manager / Users</a> help page.</p>
		
	<h3>Active Directory authentication</h3>
	<p>This requires a user to be registered within a pre-specified
		Active Directory group in order to log into Blue Prism.</p>
	
	<p>See the <a href="helpSingleSignOn.htm">Single Sign On</a> help
		page for further information.</p>
	
	<p>In order to authenticate and log into Blue Prism, the user must
		click the <code>Sign In</code> button.</p>
	
	<h3>Choosing a default connection.</h3>
	<p>The connections defined on this machine are available in the
    Connections dropdown list, the current connection being the one
    selected.</p>
	
	<p>The current connection can be changed by selecting another from
		the dropdown list. An attempt is made to
		connect using the specified details - if the attempt fails, an
		error message is displayed and the login controls are disabled.
		Otherwise, the user may continue to log into the newly chosen
		connection.</p>
	
	<p>Blue Prism will automatically connect using the user's last
		chosen connection.</p>
		
	<h3>Further login screen options</h3>
	<p>Further options are available within System Manager for the
		environment-specific presentation of the login screen.</p>
	<p>A list of the users registered within the current connection can
		be displayed (for Blue Prism authenticated connections only).
	</p>
	<p>The user name can be pre-populated from the last time that the
		user logged into the selected connection.</p>
	<p>These options are available within System Manager - see the
		<a href="helpSecurityOptions.htm">Logon Options</a> help page for
		more information.</p>
