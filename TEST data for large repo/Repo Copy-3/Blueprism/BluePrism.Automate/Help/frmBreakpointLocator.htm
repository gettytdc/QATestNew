    <h3>Locating and Managing Breakpoints</h3>

    <p>The breakpoint locator form allows you to find and manage your breakpoints. Breakpoints are
    listed in the treeview on the left sorted by name or by page, according to your preference set
    in the checkbox.</p>

    <p>Any condition set on an existing breakpoint will be displayed in the box on the right; it
    will not be editable.</p>

    <p>Individual breakpoints may be deleted by selecting the item in the treeview and clicking the
    "Clear" button. All breakpoints can be cleared at once by clicking the "Clear All" button at
    any time These changes are not reversible.</p>

    <p>If you wish to see the stage at which a breakpoint was created, you may simply double click
    the item in the treeview, or you may select it and click the "Go to Breakpoint" button.</p>
