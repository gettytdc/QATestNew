    <h3>Processes</h3>

    <p>The processes view shows a list of all available business processes, displayed in their
    process groups.</p>

	<a name="Retirement" Id="Retirement"></a>
    <h3>Process Retirement</h3>

    <p>Should a process no longer be of use, or should you wish to prevent it from being used
    temporarily, you may retire a process by dragging and dropping it from the list of processes at
    the top, into the lower list labelled "Retired Processes". Retired processes can not be run from
    another process as a subprocess.</p>

    <p>Such processes will not be available for editing, viewing, exporting etc from the
    <a href="frmProcessStudio.htm">Process Studio Menu</a>.</p>

    <p>This operation may be reversed by dragging it back from the lower list to the original list;
    the effect is immediate.</p>
