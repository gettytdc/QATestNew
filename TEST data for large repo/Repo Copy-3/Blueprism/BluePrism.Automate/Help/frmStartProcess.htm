    <h3>Start a Process</h3>

    <p>To start a single process on a single resource quickly and easily, use the Start a Process
    wizard.</p>

    <p>Three steps are required to complete the task:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Locate a Process</h3>

        <p>All available processes are presented for selection, with name, version and description
        fields. To preview the flowchart for each process, right click the process required and
        select the Preview option. To select the process that you want to run, simply click on the
        required process to highlight it, and move to step 2.</p>

        <h3>2. Choose a Resource</h3>

        <p>Once a process has been selected, choose a resource, or PC, to run it on. Simply select
        the resource required to highlight it, and move to step 3.</p>

        <h3>3. Run Process</h3>

        <p>Following the selection of both a process and resource, the process can be initiated by
        clicking the Run Process link. Selecting the Debug checkbox will run the process
        interactively, allowing you to step through each stage before it is undertaken, decide to
        stop mid-flow or view the current position in relation to the process flowchart.</p>
