	<dl class="listplease bulleted">
	
		<dt id="windowtext">WindowText</dt>
		<dd>
			The text in the window. Note that a window could be anything
			from an application window to a button to a combobox item.
			Thus it is necessary to think in context when considering
			this attribute. For example, the WindowText of a button is
			the text displayed on the button; the WindowText of an edit
			field is the text that has been entered into that field.
		</dd>

		<dt id="classname">ClassName</dt> 
		<dd>The name given to a type of control.</dd>

		
		<dt id="ctrlid">CtrlID</dt>
		<dd>The ID given to the element by the owning application.
			Not every application makes use of this feature.
		</dd>

		<dt id="ordinal">Ordinal</dt>
		<dd>The order in which the element was created by the target
			application. For example an ordinal of 1 indicates that the
			element was created first, of all elements detected in the
			target application.</dd>

		<dt id="x">X</dt>
		<dd>The X location of the element (ie horizontal location as
			measured from the left), in pixel coordinates, relative to
			the elements parent window. Note that this parent window may
			not necessarily be a top-level window but could also be some
			other type of container.</dd>
		
		<dt id="y">Y</dt>
		<dd>The Y location of the element (ie vertical location as
			measured from the top), in pixel coordinates, relative to
			the elements parent window. Note that this parent window may
			not necessarily be a top-level window but could also be some
			other type of container.</dd>

		<dt id="width">Width</dt>
		<dd>The width of the element, in pixels.</dd>

		<dt id="height">Height</dt>
		<dd>The height of the element, in pixels.</dd>

		<dt id="visible">Visible</dt>
		<dd>Indicates whether or not the element is visible. An element
			may be present, but invisible so take care when performing a
			CheckExists query on a <a 
			href="frmStagePropertiesWaitStart.htm">Wait Stage</a>.</dd>

		<dt id="enabled">Enabled</dt>
		<dd>Indicates whether the element is available for interaction
			in the target application. In everyday parlance, this notion
			may also be described as whether the element is "greyed-out"
			or "clickable". A button is a common example of an element
			which is found to be enabled or disabled depending on the
			circumstances.</dd>

		<dt id="active">Active</dt>
		<dd>Indicates whether the window is "in focus". The active
			window is the window which would process any keyboard input.
			There is usually only one active window at a time. See also
			the <code>ActivateApplication</code> command on a <a
			href="frmStagePropertiesNavigate.htm">Navigate Stage</a>.
		</dd>

		<dt id="childcount">ChildCount</dt>
		<dd>Indicates how many child windows the element contains. Note
			that this includes windows which are not visible, windows
			with small sizes, and windows obscured by other windows.
			Hence the number indicated may not correspond to what is
			visible on the screen.</dd>

	<h3 id="parent-attributes">Parent Attributes</h3>

	<dl class="listplease bulleted">
		<dt>pOrdinal, pX, pWidth, pClassName etc.</dt>
		<dd>By convention all attribute names begin with a capital
			letter. An exception to this rule is made for parent
			attributes. The attributes of an element's parent window are
			named by placing a lower case p in front of the attribute
			name. For example pOrdinal refers to the <a href="#ordinal">
			ordinal</a> of the element's parent window.
