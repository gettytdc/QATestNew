	<h3>Overview</h3>
	<p>Fonts available for use by the Font Recognition functionality can be stored and
	managed in the database using this System Manager component.</p>
	
	<h3>Importing Fonts</h3>
	<p>Fonts can be imported from XML files. Multiple fonts can be imported at one time
	by simply selecting all the files you want to import.</p>

	<p>When a font is imported, its name is taken from the name of the file. If the name
	of the file begins with 'font_' then that part is ignored. Thus, the
	files &quot;font_System.xml&quot; and &quot;System.xml&quot; would both result in
	the import of a font named 'System'.</p>

	<h3>Exporting Fonts</h3>
	<p>To export a single font, select it and click 'Export'. Then choose/select
	an appropriate location and
	filename. The font is then exported in a format that can be imported again later.</p>

	<p>To export multiple fonts, select them and click 'Export'. Then choose
	an appropriate directory, and all the selected fonts will be exported there as
	individual files. The files are named &quot;font_Name.xml&quot;. This allows them
	to be easily recognised, while ensuring that they retain their original names when
	imported again later.</p>

	<h3>Deleting Fonts</h3>
	<p>For fonts that are no longer required in the database, simply select them and
	click 'Delete'.</p>
