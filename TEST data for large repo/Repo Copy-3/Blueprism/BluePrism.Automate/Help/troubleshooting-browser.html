		<h2>Browser Integration</h2>
	</div>

	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>This page provides some common issues and suggested resolutions
	for using browser integration within Blue Prism</p>

	<h3>Multiple browser sessions don't attach properly</h3>
	<p>Internet Explorer versions 7+ introduced a feature which meant
		that separate sessions within the browser could run in separate
		processes, spawned from the primary IE process.</p>
	<p>This affects IE7 on Windows Vista or Windows 7 running in
		protected mode, and IE8+ on all versions of Windows.</p>

	<h4>Child Index</h4>

	<p>Blueprism version 4.1.3 and above has a feature which allows you
	to specify the Child Index of the process to which to attach. Each session
	is given a unique index based on the order in which the process for that
	session was created. For example the main parent process is given the
	index of 0, whereas the	first tab of the process is given the Child Index
	of 1. The Child Index parameter is specified in the attach action of a
	navigate stage.</p>

	<h4>TabProcGrowth</h4>

	<p>If the above is not appropriate for your means, as an alternative
	you can configure Internet Explorer to not create multiple processes.
	This is done by changing a registry setting, specifically the registry key: <code>
		HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main
		</code>, a DWORD value called <code>TabProcGrowth</code> should
		be set to one of the following values :-</p>
	<dl class="bulleted">
		<dt>0 (Zero)</dt>
		<dd>This disables protected mode for IE Security Zones and tells
			Internet Explorer to open tabs and frames within the same
			process.</dd>
		
		<dt>1 (One)</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>This leaves protected mode enabled, and ensures that all
			tabs in a given frame run in a single process.</p>
			<p>Note that this may require the use of process flow to
			launch and separately attach to the required IE instance.
			Two processes will still be created - one for the frame and
			one for all the tabs within that frame.</p>
		</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>Changing the value will require Internet Explorer to be restarted
		before it can pick up the new value.</p>
		
	<h4>Misaligned Highlighting</h4>
	
	<p>If you find that spying or highlighting spied elements results in the 
	highlight box being misaligned to the element you are spying or highlighting, 
	check the zoom setting in Internet Explorer (and also of your Display in Control Panel).</p>
	<p>Values other than 100% may cause this type of issue</p>
